# Death at the Frontier - Project Overview


## Game Concept
A text-based murder mystery video game set in a cutting-edge AI company (maker of a popular LLM chatbot). The player must investigate the murder of a brilliant researcher and identify the killer among five suspects, each with their own potential motives.

## Game Format
- **Text-based gameplay**: All interactions happen through text
- **LLM-powered suspects**: Each of the 5 suspects is played by an LLM with a unique prompt defining their personality, knowledge, secrets, and behavior
- **Investigation through interrogation**: The player solves the mystery by interviewing suspects, catching inconsistencies, and uncovering hidden truths through dialogue
- **Dynamic conversations**: Suspects respond naturally to questions while maintaining their character and protecting their secrets

## Setting
**General setting**: The victim and the suspects are all employees of "Frontier AI" - a frontier lab (i.e. one of the companies at the cutting edge of the LLM-based AI technology).
**Location**: To be determined 
**Time Period**: Present day


## The Crime
**Victim**: A brilliant junior researcher - ambitious, charismatic, and working on breakthrough AI technology
**Time of Death**: Between 9 PM - 2 AM
**Location**: To be determined
**Method**: To be determined 

## The Five Suspects

### Suspect A
**Position**: Senior researcher
**Motive**: AI safety concerns
- Believes the victim's work on advanced AI capabilities is recklessly dangerous
- Has been documenting safety violations
- Was preparing to go to the board of directors to shut down the victim's project
- Represents the "greater good" motive - trying to prevent potential AI catastrophe

### Suspect B
**Position**: Mid-level researcher
**Motive**: Corporate espionage
- Being paid by a rival company to steal breakthrough research
- The victim recently noticed B's suspicious behavior and started asking questions
- B was getting desperate as their cover was close to being blown
- Represents the "money/greed" motive

### Suspect C
**Position**: Department head/Senior executive
**Hidden Agenda**: Unrequited romantic feelings for the victim
- Has romantic designs on the victim that the victim is completely unaware of
- Discovered the secret relationship between the victim and E
- Deliberately orchestrated situations to make E jealous:
  - Scheduled late night "emergency meetings" with the victim
  - Praised the victim effusively in front of E
  - Dropped calculated hints about "chemistry" with the victim
- Goal was to break up E and the victim, then pursue the victim
- **Morally responsible but legally innocent** - their manipulation led to murder but they didn't commit it

### Suspect D
**Position**: Peer researcher
**Motive**: Professional resentment (weak motive/red herring)
- Resentful about being passed over for opportunities the victim received
- Spreads petty office gossip
- May have noticed C's manipulation but didn't think it significant
- Primarily serves as a red herring with minor workplace friction

### Suspect E - THE MURDERER
**Position**: Senior executive (different department than C)
**Motive**: Jealousy and betrayal
- Was in a secret relationship with the victim for months
- The relationship was kept secret due to E's senior position
- Fell completely for C's manipulation
- Became convinced the victim was using them for career advancement
- Believed the victim had moved on to C for further career benefits
- Killed the victim in a fit of rage after confronting them

## The Tragic Truth
- The victim was genuinely in love with E
- The victim was completely oblivious to C's romantic interest
- The victim thought C was simply a supportive boss and mentor
- The meetings with C were purely professional from the victim's perspective
- The victim may have been planning to go public with their relationship with E
- E killed their lover based on a false belief manufactured by C's manipulation
