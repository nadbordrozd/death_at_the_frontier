# Plot Details v5

## The Night of the Crime

### Setting

**When**: Friday night, between 11:00 PM and 11:15 PM  
**Where**: Frontier AI headquarters - the "Isolation Chamber" on the basement level. This is an RF-shielded, soundproofed room originally designed for testing AI systems without external interference. It has its own ventilation, no windows, and sits at the end of a dead-end corridor. Access requires a specialized keycard - only senior researchers and executives have clearance. The main building security cameras don't cover the basement corridor (cost-cutting measure after construction).

**Why the Isolation Chamber matters**: The basement is practically a separate building. No foot traffic after hours, no cameras in the corridor, soundproofing means no one could hear a struggle. The restricted access creates a closed circle of suspects - only certain people could have entered.

**Circumstances**: Friday was the internal demo day for Project Prometheus - the victim's breakthrough in autonomous AI reasoning. After a 6 PM champagne celebration in the main conference room, most staff filtered out. The victim stayed late to run one final validation test before Monday's board presentation.

**Why were the characters there?**

- **The Victim**: Booked the Isolation Chamber from 9 PM onward for Prometheus validation. Had also secretly arranged to meet E there at 11 PM - chose this location specifically because it guaranteed complete privacy. The victim planned to propose going public with their relationship and had drafted an HR disclosure form.

- **A**: Left the building at 9:10 PM after the party. Returned at 9:30 PM, telling the security guard they forgot their reading glasses. True reason: A had submitted a formal safety complaint about Prometheus to the board that afternoon and felt morally obligated to warn the victim before it went public Monday. A wanted to give the victim a chance to respond. A has Isolation Chamber access.

- **B**: Never left after the party. Claimed to be catching up on reports at their desk. Real purpose: to copy Project Prometheus files while the building was empty. The victim had caught B accessing restricted servers three days prior and given B until Monday to confess or be reported. B was making final copies before planning to disappear. B does NOT have Isolation Chamber access.

- **C**: Left at 8:45 PM. Returned at 10:15 PM, entering through the visitor entrance (logged at front desk). Claimed to have forgotten an important document. True purpose: to finally confess romantic feelings to the victim. After a year of obsessive love and a calculated campaign to break up the victim and E, C decided to make a direct move. C has Isolation Chamber access as a department head.

- **D**: Left at 9:15 PM. Returned at 10:30 PM claiming to retrieve a jacket. Real reason: D spotted C's car pulling into the visitor lot from the street and, being chronically nosy, followed to see what C was up to at such a late hour. D does NOT have Isolation Chamber access.

- **E**: Was not at the celebration (different department). Entered at 10:50 PM through the executive parking garage (separate badge system from main building). Had secretly arranged to meet the victim at 11 PM. E has Isolation Chamber access through executive privileges. E arrived consumed by jealousy after weeks of C's manipulation campaign - manufactured evidence that the victim was having an affair with C.

### The Deed

**Method**: Strangulation with the victim's burgundy silk scarf - a distinctive accessory the victim wore to all important occasions. The scarf was found loosened around the neck, as if the killer had checked for signs of life afterward.

**Why strangulation**: No premeditation. No weapon brought. This was an explosion of rage using whatever was at hand. The intimate, sustained nature of strangulation speaks to deep personal emotion - this was not a calculated killing.

**How it happened**:

E arrived at the Isolation Chamber at 10:55 PM. For two months, E had been tormented by C's manipulation: late-night "strategy meetings" between C and the victim, flirtatious emails E had seen, C's possessive body language whenever E was watching. E had catalogued every manufactured piece of evidence.

The victim's face lit up when E entered. "I've been waiting for this all week," the victim said, turning the laptop to show an HR Relationship Disclosure Form - both their names filled in. "No more hiding. I want everyone to know I'm with you."

E couldn't process the joy. The paranoia was too deeply rooted. "What about C? All those private meetings. Those emails. I know something is going on."

The victim made a dismissive sound - almost a laugh. "C? Please. C is my department head. Nothing more. You're seeing things that aren't there."

That dismissal - the implication that months of anguish were mere paranoia, that E's suffering was imaginary - something in E snapped. Hands found the scarf. The victim's expression shifted from confusion to fear to nothing.

E stood paralyzed for several minutes. Then, moving mechanically, E closed the laptop, straightened items in the room, and fled through the basement emergency exit to the parking garage. E drove home and spent the weekend in a dissociative haze.

### The Aftermath

**Discovery**: Security guard found the body during routine Saturday morning walkthrough at 7:15 AM. The Isolation Chamber was booked to the victim all weekend, so no one had reason to enter earlier.

**Investigation Setting**: The investigation takes place Monday morning at Frontier AI headquarters. The player is a homicide detective. The CEO has cleared a conference room for interviews and requested discretion - a murder at a frontier AI lab would devastate the company's reputation. All five suspects are required to remain available.

**Physical Evidence (Available at Start)**:

1. **Building Badge Logs**:
   - A: workday entry 8 AM; party 6 PM; exit 9:10 PM; RE-ENTRY 9:30 PM; exit 10:05 PM
   - B: entry 8 AM; party 6 PM; exit 11:55 PM (very late for "catching up on reports")
   - C: entry 8 AM; party 6 PM; exit 8:45 PM; visitor entrance 10:15 PM; exit 10:45 PM
   - D: entry 8 AM; party 6 PM; exit 9:15 PM; re-entry 10:30 PM; exit 10:45 PM
   - E: No record on main building system Friday evening
   - *Note*: Executive parking garage uses separate badge system (requires security director approval to access)

2. **Isolation Chamber Access Log** (separate system):
   - Victim: entered 9:15 PM, no exit logged
   - A: entered 9:35 PM, exited 9:55 PM
   - C: entered 10:20 PM, exited 10:40 PM
   - *Note*: Emergency exit does not log - fire code compliance only

3. **Victim's Phone**: Last text at 10:48 PM to an unsaved number (prepaid phone): "Can't wait to see you. Big surprise tonight. I love you ❤️"

4. **Victim's Laptop** (found in Isolation Chamber): Shows Prometheus validation scripts. Also contains an HR "Relationship Disclosure Form" - but the form was closed without saving and the partner name field shows only "E——" (first letter visible, rest blank). Document properties show last edit at 10:52 PM.

5. **Printed Email on Victim's Desk** (regular office, not Isolation Chamber): From C, dated Wednesday: "Late night strategy session tonight? Just us. I'll bring wine. —C" Victim's handwritten note in margin: "??? C is being weird again. Need to set boundaries."

6. **The Burgundy Scarf**: Victim's signature accessory, found loosened around neck. No foreign DNA recovered (killer wore gloves or shed nothing).

7. **Security Guard Statement**: Notes that C appeared "visibly upset, maybe crying" when leaving at 10:45 PM. Guard assumed bad phone call.

## The Investigation

### Clues from Suspect A (Senior Researcher - Safety Advocate)

**Freely shared:**
1. A attended the party and gave a toast to the victim's success (publicly supportive)
2. A and the victim had professional disagreements about AI safety - known throughout the company
3. B seemed "agitated" at the party - kept stepping outside, checking phone obsessively
4. The victim "attracted strong feelings from people" - some admiring, some less healthy

**Discoverable with probing:**
5. A's badge shows re-entry at 9:30 for "forgotten glasses" but they stayed 35 minutes. Why so long?
6. The Isolation Chamber log shows A was definitely in that room with the victim - contradicting initial denial
7. A overheard the victim on the phone last week, sounding upset, saying "I can't keep lying to everyone about us"
8. When pressed about professional conflicts, A becomes evasive - hiding something significant

**Big Secret**: A submitted a comprehensive safety complaint to the board Friday afternoon. The document alleged the victim was recklessly rushing Prometheus toward deployment without adequate safeguards. If the board accepted it, the victim's career at Frontier AI would be over - and likely their career anywhere in the industry. A went to the Isolation Chamber that night to give the victim a chance to withdraw the project before Monday. The victim was hurt but not hostile. A left at 9:55 PM with the victim very much alive. A's guilt: they tried to destroy the victim professionally, and hours later the victim was dead. The timeline looks like escalation.

**Unlocking Payoff**: When confronted with the complaint (C was CC'd as department head; B saw it while monitoring internal systems), A breaks: "I was trying to protect people! Prometheus is dangerous. But when I told the victim what I'd done, they were... disappointed, not angry. They said they understood I was acting on principle. They weren't thinking about work that night - kept glancing at the clock, clearly waiting for someone. When I left, they were alive and practically glowing with anticipation. And I saw something I should have mentioned immediately: when I was walking to my car at 10:05 PM, I saw C's car pull into the visitor lot. C didn't see me. Whatever happened in that room after I left - C went in there next."

---

### Clues from Suspect B (Mid-level Researcher - Corporate Spy)

**Freely shared:**
1. Was finishing quarterly documentation, left around 11:30 PM
2. Noticed someone else working late - heard footsteps in the hallway around 10:30
3. The victim was brilliant but "collected enemies" - vague comment without specifics
4. D "notices everything and everyone" - seems to watch people

**Discoverable with probing:**
5. Badge shows exit at 11:55 PM, not "around 11:30" - what were those extra 25 minutes?
6. B doesn't have Isolation Chamber access but knows the victim was working there. How?
7. B becomes noticeably nervous when the victim's name comes up in certain contexts
8. IT logs show B accessing unusual file servers Friday night - significant data transfers

**Big Secret**: B is a corporate spy for Nexus Labs, Frontier's primary competitor. For eighteen months, B systematically copied research data. Three days before the murder, the victim noticed B's suspicious file access and confronted them privately. The victim gave B until Monday to confess to HR - or be reported. B spent Friday night making final copies of Prometheus data, planning to flee over the weekend. Now B is trapped: running looks like fleeing a murder, but staying risks the espionage being exposed.

**Unlocking Payoff**: When exposed (A overheard the victim sounding betrayed; D noticed B's nervous behavior; file transfer logs), B becomes desperately cooperative: "Fine. I'm a spy. The victim caught me. But I didn't hurt anyone - corporate espionage isn't murder. Here's what I actually know: I was monitoring internal systems that night - part of my job for Nexus. Around 10:35 PM, I saw C rush toward the basement stairs. At 10:45, C came back looking absolutely wrecked - mascara running, hands shaking. C didn't notice me. Later, around 11 PM, I went to stretch my legs and saw D standing near the basement corridor entrance, just watching. And one more thing: the executive parking garage log - it's on a separate network but I had access. Someone with executive clearance entered at 10:50 PM. I couldn't see who from the logs, but someone was in this building who isn't on the main badge records."

### Clues from Suspect C (Department Head - Manipulator)

**Freely shared:**
1. Returned to retrieve an important document from their desk
2. Saw the victim briefly - just a professional hello
3. The victim seemed "distracted" lately - always rushing off, mind elsewhere
4. E seems to be taking the death "unusually hard" - more than a professional relationship would explain

**Discoverable with probing:**
5. C's "forgotten document" was supposedly on their desk, but the Isolation Chamber log shows C spent 20 minutes there. Why?
6. The email found on the victim's desk has an unusual tone - not standard professional correspondence. C claims "just friendly banter"
7. C knows suspicious details about E's schedule and emotional state - claims "management awareness"
8. Security noted C left "visibly upset, maybe crying" - what happened in the Isolation Chamber?

**Big Secret**: C has been obsessively in love with the victim for over a year. Having noticed the secret relationship between the victim and E (careful observation of body language, schedule overlaps, stolen glances), C set out to destroy it. C scheduled unnecessary late-night meetings with the victim, wrote emails with romantic undertones knowing E monitored the victim's communications, and made sure to be physically affectionate with the victim when E was watching. The goal: make E so jealous the relationship would implode, freeing the victim for C. That Friday night, C finally confessed their feelings directly. The victim was kind but firm in rejection - they loved someone else. C is morally responsible for manufacturing E's murderous jealousy, though C never imagined it would end in violence.

**Unlocking Payoff**: When confronted with the pattern (D's observations of possessive behavior, A seeing C arrive, E's eventual description of the jealousy, the suspicious emails), C shatters: "I loved them. I've loved them for over a year. They never saw me that way - I was just a mentor, a boss. But I knew about E. I watched them together for months, the secret smiles, leaving at the same time. I thought if I could make E doubt... if E believed there was something between me and the victim... I never wanted anyone to die. When I went to the Isolation Chamber that night, I told the victim everything. They were so gentle saying no. They said they were in love with someone else - someone they were planning to 'finally go public with' that very night. They asked me to leave because they were expecting that person. It was E. And I'm the reason E killed them. Every email I wrote, every meeting I manufactured - E must have seen all of it. I created the jealousy. I murdered the person I loved through someone else's hands."

---

### Clues from Suspect D (Peer Researcher - Observer)

**Freely shared:**
1. Came back for a jacket left in their cubicle
2. Didn't see anything unusual - quick in and out
3. There's been "office drama" around the victim, but D tries to stay out of it
4. C has always been "very attentive" to the victim - more than normal manager behavior

**Discoverable with probing:**
5. D actually followed C back to the building (saw C's car at the traffic light). Why so interested?
6. D saw C emerge from the basement corridor looking devastated - but the jacket cubicle is nowhere near the basement
7. D has noticed C's behavior toward the victim for months - touching, interrupting conversations, jealous glances
8. D has suspicions about the victim's romantic life - has seen things that point to E

**Big Secret**: D has engaged in petty workplace sabotage against the victim for nearly a year. Jealous of the victim's rapid rise while D remained overlooked, D deleted the victim's calendar invites, "forgot" to forward important emails, and spread subtle rumors questioning the originality of the victim's work. D is deeply ashamed - systematic sabotage looks pathological in a murder investigation. D fears the detective will see someone capable of sustained pettiness as capable of escalating to violence.

**Unlocking Payoff**: When confronted (B noticed calendar tampering while monitoring systems; A mentioned victim complaining about missed meetings; C mentioned victim's frustration), D is mortified but fully cooperative: "Yes. I was jealous. Petty. The victim got everything - praise, resources, the fast track - while I got nothing. So I made their life harder. It was wrong. But sabotaging someone's calendar isn't murder. And since we're being honest: I followed C that night because I'm a gossip and I wanted to know what was happening. I saw C come out of the basement corridor around 10:40, looking destroyed - like they'd been crying. Then I hung around because I was curious. And around 10:50, I saw someone enter through the executive parking entrance. I couldn't see their face clearly - the basement garage is dim - but the body language, the way they moved... I'm almost certain it was E. And I've thought for months that the victim and E were secretly together. I saw them once, leaving in the same car, sitting too close. If E went to the Isolation Chamber that night, right after C had just been there playing whatever games C plays..."

### Clues from Suspect E (Senior Executive - The Murderer)

**Freely shared:**
1. Was not at the celebration - different department, separate schedule
2. Spent Friday evening at home - early night, watched a documentary
3. Expresses appropriate professional grief - "a tremendous loss"
4. Knew the victim through cross-departmental projects, nothing more personal

**Discoverable with probing:**
5. E's alibi is completely unverifiable - lives alone, no smart home devices, no delivery records, no calls made
6. E becomes visibly uncomfortable when the victim's personal life is discussed
7. E knows oddly specific details about C's behavior toward the victim - meeting schedules, email patterns - strange for someone with no personal stake
8. E has executive parking access (separate from main building logs)
9. When asked if the victim was romantically involved with anyone, E's expression flickers with pain before the mask returns

**Big Secret**: E killed the victim. E and the victim had been secretly together for eight months, hiding the relationship due to E's senior position. Over two months, E became consumed by jealousy as C's manipulation campaign took effect - manufactured emails, orchestrated meetings, calculated body language. E went to the Isolation Chamber that night intending to demand commitment: either the victim would prove their love by going public immediately, or E would end things. When the victim denied any interest in C - truthfully - E's paranoid mind interpreted this as gaslighting. The murder was not planned; it erupted from months of manufactured suspicion colliding with the victim's earnest love.

**Unlocking Payoff** (staged):

*Stage 1 - The Relationship*: When confronted with evidence of the romance (D's observation of them together, the loving text to a prepaid phone, the disclosure form being drafted for someone whose name starts with E):
E admits: "Yes. We were together. Eight months. We hid it because of my position - policies, optics. I loved them. But I was home Friday night. I wasn't there."

*Stage 2 - The Jealousy*: When confronted with what drove E's suspicions (C's confession of manipulation, D's observations, the manufactured emails):
E's composure cracks: "You can't understand. Watching C touch them constantly. Finding those emails - 'Just us tonight.' 'I'll bring wine.' What was I supposed to think? The victim kept saying I was paranoid, that C was just a supportive boss. But the evidence was everywhere. I was losing my mind."

*Stage 3 - The Confession*: When confronted with complete evidence (D saw someone from executive parking enter at 10:50; B's monitoring confirms executive garage entry at 10:50; C and A both confirm victim was alive during their visits and expecting someone; the disclosure form was clearly being drafted for E; the timeline leaves only E with access and opportunity):
E breaks completely: "I went there to save us. The victim was so happy when I arrived. They showed me the disclosure form - they wanted to go public. They loved me. Only me. They said C was like a 'strange aunt' to them - harmless but annoying. Something about that dismissal - like my months of suffering were nothing - I snapped. I grabbed their scarf. I remember their face. The surprise. Then the fear. I didn't mean to... I didn't... They were choosing me. They had already chosen me. And I killed them because C made me believe a lie. The victim loved me. And I murdered them for it."

## Gameplay

### Chain of Deduction 1: Following the Romance

1. **Opening**: Player reviews evidence. The victim's text mentions love (❤️) to a prepaid phone - who was the victim meeting? The disclosure form shows "E——" but wasn't saved.

2. **Interview E** (routine) → E claims professional relationship only. But E knows a lot about C's meetings with the victim. Why would E care?

3. **Interview C** → C mentions victim was "distracted" lately, and that E is taking the death "unusually hard." When asked about the flirty email, C deflects.

4. **Interview D** → D mentions C was "very attentive" to the victim. When pushed, D admits following C back to the building, saw C emerge from the basement looking devastated.

5. **Press D further** → D reveals seeing someone enter via executive parking around 10:50. Body language suggested it was E. Also mentions suspecting victim and E were together.

6. **Return to C** with D's observations and the email pattern → C breaks. Confesses year-long obsession and manipulation campaign. Reveals victim was expecting someone they loved - someone they were "going public with" that night. C suspects E.

7. **Return to E** with C's confession → Describe the manipulation campaign. Watch E's reaction - recognition, then fury, then grief. E begins to realize they were played.

8. **Request executive parking logs** → E entered at 10:50 PM. No exit logged on that system.

9. **Final confrontation with E** → Present the complete picture: C's manufactured evidence, D seeing E enter, B's system monitoring confirming the garage entry, A and C both confirming victim was alive but expecting someone. The disclosure form was for E. E confesses.

### Chain of Deduction 2: Following the Timeline

1. **Opening**: Player notes B stayed extremely late (11:55 PM badge, claims 11:30). Also, A returned for "glasses" but stayed 35 minutes.

2. **Interview A** → A's account doesn't match the Isolation Chamber log - A was definitely in that room. Pressed, A admits the conversation. Also mentions B was "agitated" at the party, and overheard victim sounding betrayed recently.

3. **Confront B** with timeline discrepancy and victim's apparent discovery → B confesses to espionage. In exchange for cooperation, B reveals: saw C rush to basement at 10:35, return devastated at 10:45; saw D lurking near basement around 11 PM; and the executive parking log shows an entry at 10:50 PM.

4. **This establishes**: Multiple people visited victim that night. Victim was alive when C left at 10:40 (both A and B confirm C's emotional state). Someone with executive access entered at 10:50.

5. **Interview D** → D admits following C, saw C leave distraught. Also saw someone from executive parking enter around 10:50 - thinks it was E. Mentions suspecting victim and E were secretly together.

6. **Review physical evidence** → Disclosure form shows "E——" as the partner. Victim's text at 10:48 PM expressed love to someone they were about to see.

7. **Confront E about the relationship** → E denies, then admits when confronted with D's observations and the text. Claims to have been home.

8. **Request executive parking logs** → E entered at 10:50 PM. E was the last person to see the victim alive.

9. **Final confrontation** → E was there. E was the person victim was waiting for. E's jealousy of C (deliberately manufactured) reached critical mass. E confesses.

## Critique

### Changes from v4

1. **Made disclosure form more subtle**: Changed from completely blank partner field to "E——" (first letter visible, rest truncated/unsaved). This gives the player a strong hint without being a neon sign. It suggests E but doesn't prove it - the player must still connect the dots.

2. **Tightened murder window further**: Now 11:00-11:15 PM instead of 10:55-11:10. E arrives at 10:55, reaches the chamber, has the conversation with the victim showing the disclosure form, E's paranoia erupts, and the murder occurs around 11:10. Exit by 11:15. Very tight.

3. **Renamed "Deep Lab" to "Isolation Chamber"**: More evocative name that immediately communicates its purpose (isolation, privacy, soundproofing). Also explains why it's RF-shielded without lengthy exposition about AI testing.

4. **Strengthened victim's marginal note**: Now reads "??? C is being weird again. Need to set boundaries." This shows the victim was aware of C's inappropriate behavior but misread it as mere weirdness, not a calculated campaign. Adds tragedy - the victim saw the warning signs but couldn't interpret them.

5. **Made B's observation angle clearer**: B specifically mentions having access to internal systems "as part of my job for Nexus" - explicitly ties the surveillance capability to the espionage rather than leaving it ambiguous.

6. **Adjusted A's timeline**: A now leaves at 9:55 PM (exiting building at 10:05), giving a cleaner 25-minute gap between A's exit and C's entry to the chamber. This avoids any overlap confusion.

7. **Clarified the emotional climax**: E's confession now includes the victim's exact words dismissing C ("strange aunt"), which shows both the victim's innocent misreading of the situation AND why that dismissal triggered E's rage - E's months of suffering being treated as nothing.

### Strengths Maintained

1. **Tragic irony**: E killed the person who loved them most, based on evidence C manufactured. The victim was about to go public. Devastating emotional payoff.

2. **Moral complexity**: C is morally responsible but legally innocent. C didn't commit murder but created its conditions. This creates interesting moral space.

3. **Interconnected clue network**: Every secret unlocks through multiple paths. Every unlock provides new clues about others.

4. **Natural conversation hooks**: Both gameplay chains start with things a new player would naturally ask ("Why were you really here for 35 minutes?" "Why did you leave 25 minutes later than you said?").

5. **Escalating reveals**: Each secret unlocked cascades into new information.

### Potential Issues and Mitigations

**1. "E——" on disclosure form - too obvious?**
- Mitigation: "E" could theoretically stand for something other than a name - employee ID prefix, an abbreviation, etc. The player needs corroborating evidence.
- Multiple suspects could theoretically have names starting with E (though none of our other suspects do in this outline - we'll need to ensure this in character naming).

**2. Why didn't anyone hear anything?**
- Mitigation: Isolation Chamber is soundproofed. RF shielding also implies acoustic isolation. It's in a basement at the end of a dead-end corridor.
- Strangulation is relatively quiet compared to other methods.

**3. Why didn't E's phone ping in the area?**
- E could claim phone was left at home or in the car (which was in the garage, not GPS-tracked).
- The executive parking garage is underground, potentially blocking cell signals.
- This is a plausible real-world explanation many people would accept.

**4. How does B have access to executive parking logs?**
- B is an 18-month veteran corporate spy with sophisticated system access. Monitoring internal networks is explicitly part of their espionage.
- The executive garage log being on a "separate network" that B "had access to" is explained by B's spy activities.

**5. Every secret is meaningful**

| Character | Secret | Why It Matters |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| E | Murder | The crime itself |
| C | Manipulation | Explains WHY E killed - essential context |
| B | Espionage | Provides key timeline evidence (garage entry) + cooperation motive |
| A | Safety complaint | Provides timeline (saw C arriving) + confirms victim alive |
| D | Sabotage | Provides eyewitness testimony (saw E enter) |

**6. Multiple paths to each secret - verified**

| Secret | Discovery Routes |
|--------|-----------------|
| A's complaint | C (board CC), B (internal systems), A's timeline lies |
| B's espionage | A (victim's betrayal), D (nervous behavior), timeline inconsistencies, IT logs |
| C's manipulation | D (behavior observations), A (saw C arrive), E (jealousy source), emails, guard observation |
| D's sabotage | B (system tampering), A (missed meetings), C (victim's frustration) |
| E's murder | D (saw entry + suspected relationship), C (identifies E as target), B (garage log), A (timeline), physical evidence |

**7. Bootstrapping - how does a new player start?**
- A returned for "glasses" but stayed 35 minutes - obvious hook
- B left 25 minutes later than claimed - timeline discrepancy
- C was seen crying when leaving - what happened?
- The victim's text shows they were in love - with whom?
- The disclosure form shows "E——" - who is E?
- Multiple natural entry points

### Final Assessment

Version 5 refines v4's already strong foundation. The "E——" clue creates a middle ground between "too obvious" and "impossible to deduce" - it points a direction without providing certainty. The tighter timeline (11:00-11:15 death window) makes E's guilt more damning once established. The strengthened victim's note adds to the tragedy.

The investigation can begin from:
- **Romance thread**: Who was the victim in love with?
- **Timeline thread**: Who is lying about when they were here?
- **Behavior thread**: Why was C crying? Why does E know so much?

All paths converge on E through different evidence chains, and the emotional payoff - that E killed the person who loved them most because C constructed an elaborate lie - remains devastating.

The difficulty balance is appropriate: not obvious from the start, but a thoughtful player following natural questions will reach the truth.
