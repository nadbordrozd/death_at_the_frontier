| Someone (B) arriving, going around to back of house | Only after leaking is confronted (defensive move) |

## Summary: Revelation Difficulty

### Freely Given (Easy)
- **Everyone noticed E left early and upset** (A, B, C, D all mention this)
- D saw E and Rachel kissing (establishes relationship)
- Everyone heard "personal changes" comment (ambiguous)
- C knows Rachel was going to report A
- D saw A with reporter
- E knows A was leaking
- A, B, C, D all drop clues about each other's suspicious behavior
- **E reveals D's sabotage** (and that D distracted him with gossip)

### Medium Difficulty
- B's real reason for returning (USB drive / files)
- E admits relationship when confronted with evidence
- C's detailed knowledge of Rachel's home and habits
- D admits to professional jealousy

### Hard Difficulty
- A admits to leaking campaign (when confronted with C/D/E's clues)
- B admits to corporate espionage (under intense pressure)
- D admits to sabotage (when confronted with A/B/E's accounts or pressured as suspect)
- C confronted with evidence of lies (B's dinner story, D's observations)

### Very Hard (Locked Behind Other Confessions)
- **A's testimony** (E's car, B lurking) — only after leaking confronted
- **B's testimony** (saw E leaving) — only after espionage confessed
- **D's big clue about C** ("That's what you get") — only after sabotage confessed
- **C's full confession** (manipulation campaign) — only after confronted with B + D evidence
- **E's confession** — after confronted with relationship, jealousy, A's testimony, B's testimony

## Key Investigative Locks

| Lock Type | Character | Secret Locked | Key to Unlock |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Conversational** | A | Saw E's car + B at scene | Must first admit to leaking campaign |
| **Locational** | B | Saw E leaving through back gate | Must first admit to espionage (explains why B was at back of house) |
| **Sequential** | D | C said "That's what you get" | Must first admit to sabotage |
| **Evidence-based** | C | Full manipulation confession | Must be confronted with B's lie + D's observation |
| **Multi-source** | E | Murder confession | Relationship + jealousy + witness testimony (A and/or B) |
