# Plot Details v1

## The Night of the Crime

### Setting
**When**: Friday night, between 10 PM and midnight
**Where**: Frontier AI headquarters - specifically, a small private conference room on the 4th floor (the research floor) known as "The Fishbowl" due to its glass walls. The building has security badge access but minimal after-hours surveillance (a plot point - the company has privacy-conscious policies about not monitoring employees).

**Circumstances**: The company was hosting a Friday evening celebration for a major research milestone - the successful completion of the victim's breakthrough project. Most staff left by 9 PM, but several people stayed late. The victim had announced earlier that day they would be working late to finish documentation.

**Why were the characters there?**
- **The Victim**: Stayed to work on documentation for the breakthrough project, also planning to meet E privately
- **A**: Stayed late, ostensibly to congratulate the victim, actually to make one last attempt to convince them to delay publishing their "dangerous" research
- **B**: Claimed to be finishing their own work, actually stayed to attempt accessing the victim's research files while the building was quiet
- **C**: Left the party but returned later (around 10:30 PM), claiming they forgot their laptop - actually hoping for a private moment with the victim
- **D**: Left after the party, but came back around 11 PM to retrieve a personal item - witnessed something suspicious
- **E**: Never officially at the party (different department), but secretly came to the building to meet the victim for a planned late-night rendezvous

### The Deed
**Method**: Blunt force trauma - the victim was struck from behind with a heavy glass award (ironically, an innovation award the victim had received that evening). The award was found near the body.

**How it happened**: 
E arrived at the building around 11:15 PM, using their executive badge. E had been stewing for days over C's manipulation - the "emergency meetings," the way C touched the victim's arm at the party, the way the victim seemed to light up around C. E came intending to confront the victim about "the affair with C."

The victim was genuinely shocked and hurt by the accusation, denying everything and not understanding where this was coming from. The victim even laughed dismissively at the idea of C being interested in them, which E interpreted as mocking. In the heated argument, the victim revealed they had been about to propose making their relationship public - they had drafted an HR disclosure form that very day.

This revelation made everything worse for E - if the victim was planning to go public, why all the secret meetings with C? E lost control. They grabbed the nearest heavy object (the glass award on the table) and struck the victim. It was not premeditated but happened in a moment of blind rage.

E immediately panicked. They wiped down the award (poorly - their prints are not on it but the wiping is evident), left the building via a fire exit that doesn't log badge data, and drove home.

### Timeline

| Time | What Actually Happened | What They Tell Investigator |
|------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| 9:00 PM | Party winding down, most leave | Everyone agrees on this |
| 9:15 PM | Victim goes to Fishbowl to work | Everyone knows victim stayed |
| 9:30 PM | A approaches victim in Fishbowl for private conversation about safety concerns | A claims they congratulated victim briefly and left the building |
| 10:00 PM | A leaves building (badge log confirms) | A confirms this |
| 10:15 PM | B sneaks to victim's office (not Fishbowl) to access files | B claims they were at their own desk finishing work |
| 10:30 PM | C returns to building ("forgot laptop") | C confirms returning for laptop |
| 10:45 PM | C finds victim in Fishbowl, has awkward flirtatious conversation | C claims brief professional exchange, left immediately |
| 10:50 PM | C leaves building | C confirms |
| 11:00 PM | D returns for personal item, sees C leaving looking flustered | D initially says nothing, eventually reveals seeing C |
| 11:05 PM | D retrieves item, passes Fishbowl, sees victim alive and working | D initially vague, eventually confirms seeing victim alive |
| 11:10 PM | D leaves building | D confirms |
| 11:15 PM | E arrives via parking garage, badges in | E claims they were never at the building |
| 11:20 PM | E confronts victim in Fishbowl | — |
| 11:35 PM | E kills victim | — |
| 11:40 PM | E exits via fire exit (no badge log) | — |
| 7:00 AM | Saturday morning - cleaning staff discovers body | — |

### The Aftermath
**Discovery**: The body was discovered Saturday morning at 7 AM by the weekend cleaning crew. The building's head of security immediately called police.

**Investigation setting**: The investigation takes place Monday morning at Frontier AI headquarters. The player is a detective who has requested that all five suspects remain available for questioning. Each suspect has a private office or meeting room where they can be interviewed.

The company's HR and Legal have provided badge access logs, which show:
- A entered 6 PM (party), left 10:00 PM
- B entered 6 PM (party), left 11:30 PM
- C entered 6 PM (party), left 9:15 PM, re-entered 10:30 PM, left 10:50 PM
- D entered 6 PM (party), left 9:00 PM, re-entered 11:00 PM, left 11:10 PM
- E: No record of entering that evening (executive parking/fire exit route avoided main badge readers)

The victim's phone was found, showing a text at 11:10 PM to an unsaved number: "Almost done. Can't wait to see you. ❤️" This number traces to a burner phone (E's).

## The Investigation

### Clues from Suspect A (Senior Researcher - Safety Concerns)

**Freely shared:**
1. A was one of the last to leave the party and spoke with the victim briefly
2. A has been vocal about AI safety concerns with the victim's project
3. A noticed that B seemed nervous at the party and kept checking their phone

**Discoverable with probing:**
4. A had a heated 30-minute conversation with the victim that night about the dangers of the project (not the "brief congratulations" they initially claimed) - contradicts their statement about leaving quickly
5. A knows that the victim had complained about B "snooping around" their files recently

**Big Secret:** A had drafted an anonymous letter to the board that would have ended the victim's career and possibly gotten them fired. A feels guilty that they were planning to destroy the victim professionally and now the victim is dead. A fears this makes them look like a killer.

**Unlocking payoff:** When confronted with the anonymous letter, A breaks down and reveals: "I was angry, yes. But I saw something that night that I didn't want to mention because it would reveal how long I was really there. Around 10:45, I was in the parking lot working up the courage to go back and apologize to the victim. I saw C practically running out of the building, looking completely rattled. Not 'forgot my laptop' energy - more like something happened in there."

---

### Clues from Suspect B (Mid-level Researcher - Corporate Spy)

**Freely shared:**
1. B was working late on their own project
2. B heard voices from the Fishbowl around 10:45 PM - at least two people talking
3. B left around 11:30 PM (badge confirms)

**Discoverable with probing:**
4. B actually went to the victim's office that night (not their own desk) - they can be caught in this lie through badge sector data or by noting their desk is nowhere near where they claim to have heard the voices
5. B knew the victim suspected them of something - victim had confronted B earlier that week

**Big Secret:** B is a corporate spy for rival company Nexus Labs. The victim had figured this out and confronted B on Wednesday, giving B until Monday to confess to HR or the victim would report them. B was desperate and terrified that night.

**Unlocking payoff:** When exposed as the spy, B becomes cooperative to avoid murder charges: "Look, I didn't kill anyone. But I'll tell you what I really saw. I was in the victim's office around 10:45, yes. I heard someone come in the main door - I hid. Then I heard voices from down the hall. C's voice, I'm sure of it. C sounded... intense. Not angry, but weirdly emotional. I couldn't make out words. After C left, I finished what I was doing and left. The victim was definitely still alive - I heard them typing as I passed the Fishbowl."

---

### Clues from Suspect C (Department Head - Manipulator)

**Freely shared:**
1. C came back for their laptop around 10:30 PM
2. C spoke briefly with the victim, who seemed fine
3. C mentions that the victim was "so dedicated, always working late, sometimes with E from the other department"

**Discoverable with probing:**
4. C's "forgot laptop" story is weak - why not retrieve it the next day? What was so urgent on a Friday night?
5. C seems to know a lot about E's schedule and whereabouts - more than a department head in a different division should know

**Big Secret:** C has been systematically manipulating E for months, manufacturing situations to make E believe the victim was having an affair with C. C's motive was to break up E and the victim so C could pursue the victim. C is morally responsible for the murder but didn't commit it.

**Unlocking payoff:** When confronted with the manipulation (evidence from E or D about C's behavior), C's composure cracks: "I loved them. I thought if I could just... I never meant for anyone to get hurt. Yes, I tried to make E jealous. I scheduled those late meetings. I made sure E saw us together. But I didn't know E would... Oh god. That night, I came back hoping the victim would be alone. We talked for maybe fifteen minutes. I tried to... express my feelings. The victim looked at me like I was insane, said they were waiting for someone. I left humiliated. But they were ALIVE when I left. E must have... it has to be E."

---

### Clues from Suspect D (Peer Researcher - Red Herring/Observer)

**Freely shared:**
1. D returned to get a charger they left in the break room
2. D saw the victim alive through the Fishbowl windows as they walked past
3. D mentions general office gossip about workplace tensions

**Discoverable with probing:**
4. D actually saw C leaving the building looking upset - D was arriving just as C was leaving
5. D has noticed C acting strangely around the victim for months - lingering touches, intense stares

**Big Secret:** D has been engaging in petty sabotage against the victim - deleting meeting invites, "losing" messages, spreading rumors about the victim taking credit for others' work. D feels guilty and doesn't want this pettiness exposed, fearing it makes them look like they had motive.

**Unlocking payoff:** When confronted with the sabotage, D is embarrassed but becomes fully cooperative: "Fine, yes, I was jealous and petty. But I didn't kill anyone over a promotion. What I didn't want to admit is that I saw something weird. When I was leaving around 11:10, I passed by the Fishbowl. The victim was on the phone, and they looked... happy. Excited, even. They said something like 'See you soon, love.' They were expecting someone. Someone they were in a relationship with. And I've had my suspicions about who that might be - E has been acting odd lately. Secretive. And I once saw the victim and E leaving a restaurant together in a part of town where neither of them live."

### Clues from Suspect E (Senior Executive - The Murderer)

**Freely shared:**
1. E was not at the party (different department)
2. E claims to have been home all evening
3. E seems appropriately shocked and saddened by the death

**Discoverable with probing:**
4. E's alibi is weak - no one can confirm they were home, their phone location data shows the phone was home but that proves nothing (could have left phone at home)
5. E becomes defensive when asked about their relationship with the victim - claims it was purely professional

**Big Secret:** E killed the victim in a jealous rage, believing C's manufactured lies about an affair. E and the victim were in a secret romantic relationship.

**Unlocking payoff:** E's confession comes in stages:
- First, when confronted with evidence of the relationship (the text message, D's observation, the HR disclosure draft found on victim's computer): E admits to the relationship but maintains they weren't there that night
- Second, when confronted with C's manipulation and the fact that others saw the victim alive after 11 PM, E's alibi crumbles
- Finally, when confronted with the fire exit route, E breaks down: "They were going to go public with C. That's what I thought. All those late nights, the way C looked at them... I went there to confront them. They denied everything. They LAUGHED at me, said I was being paranoid about C. They said they had drafted HR paperwork for US. And I just... I saw the award. I don't remember picking it up. I just remember... god, what have I done? They loved me. They really loved me. And I killed them."

## Gameplay

### Chain of Deduction 1: Starting with the Timeline

1. **Opening**: Player reviews badge logs provided in intro. Notes C returned late (10:30-10:50 PM) and D also returned late (11:00-11:10 PM).

2. **Ask D about returning late** → D mentions seeing C leaving looking upset. D also saw victim alive at ~11:05 PM.

3. **Confront C about being upset** → C deflects, claims brief professional conversation. But player notes C seems overly interested in E.

4. **Ask D what they know about C** → D reveals they've noticed C acting strangely around victim for months.

5. **Ask C directly about feelings for victim** → C denies but badly. Player notices C keeps mentioning E unprompted.

6. **Ask D about E** → D reveals suspicion about victim and E being in a secret relationship (restaurant sighting).

7. **Confront E about relationship** → E denies initially, but when pressed with text message evidence, admits to relationship but claims wasn't there that night.

8. **Ask C about E's relationship with victim** → C finally admits to the manipulation scheme, implicates E directly.

9. **Confront E with full picture** → C's confession + victim alive after 11:05 + E's weak alibi + fire exit route = E confesses.

### Chain of Deduction 2: Starting with the Espionage

1. **Opening**: Player notices B's badge shows they left at 11:30 PM - very late. Seems suspicious.

2. **Ask B about working late** → B gives vague answers about their own project.

3. **Ask A about the party** → A mentions B seemed nervous, kept checking phone.

4. **Press A about what they know about B** → A reveals victim complained about B "snooping around files."

5. **Confront B about snooping** → B deflects but becomes nervous.

6. **Ask victim's colleagues (A or D) about any conflicts** → Learn victim confronted B earlier that week.

7. **Confront B with espionage theory** → B confesses to being a spy, but in doing so, reveals what they witnessed: C's emotional conversation with victim, C's voice, timing.

8. **Confront C with B's account** → C admits to coming back hoping to confess feelings. C reveals the manipulation of E.

9. **Focus shifts to E** → Player investigates E with new context, leading to confession.

## Critique

### Strengths
1. **Connected clues**: Every secret can be uncovered through multiple paths. No dead ends.
2. **Escalating revelations**: Each unlocked secret provides new information about others.
3. **Clear motive structure**: Money (B), ideology (A), jealousy (E), manipulation (C), pettiness (D) - all distinct and understandable.
4. **Tragic core**: The emotional truth that E killed their lover over C's lies is compelling and satisfying to uncover.

### Potential Issues

**1. Difficulty Balance - MEDIUM CONCERN**
- The plot might be slightly too easy if players immediately focus on E's lack of alibi
- Mitigation: E's executive status and seemingly appropriate emotional response could initially make them seem less suspicious
- The text to an "unsaved number" might be too obvious a breadcrumb to E
- Consider: Make the burner phone angle harder to follow (phone destroyed, number disconnected)

**2. Plausibility Issues - LOW CONCERN**
- Why no cameras? Addressed through company privacy policy (actually plausible for AI companies)
- Why did E use a badge to enter but fire exit to leave? Panic makes people do illogical things
- Why didn't E have an alibi prepared? Crime was not premeditated - crime of passion
- The fire exit route needs to be established in the intro as a known way to leave without logging

**3. Complexity - MEDIUM CONCERN**
- Five suspects with five secrets plus the murder might be a lot to track
- Mitigation: D's secret is minor and mostly serves as comic relief/easy early unlock. A's secret is similarly guilt-driven rather than plot-critical.
- The core triangle (C manipulates E into killing victim) is simple enough to remember

**4. Connection Issues - LOW CONCERN**
- All secrets are discoverable through other characters ✓
- Most have 2+ characters providing clues ✓
- Payoffs lead to new discoveries ✓
- D's secret has the weakest connections - consider having B more explicitly notice D's sabotage

**5. Meaningful Secrets - LOW CONCERN**
- E: Murder - obviously meaningful
- C: Manipulation - drives the entire tragedy
- B: Espionage - provides key timeline witness
- A: Anonymous letter - provides eyewitness account of C
- D: Sabotage - provides romantic relationship evidence
- All secrets unlock useful information when revealed ✓

**6. Phone/Modern Technology - LOW CONCERN**
- The text message is used as evidence, not ignored
- Badge system is central to the mystery
- E's phone being at home while E wasn't is acknowledged as possible
- Could add: victim's phone showing no messages to/from C (supporting that C's interest was one-sided and unknown to victim)

### Recommendations for v2
1. Strengthen the clues leading to D's secret (currently the weakest links)
2. Consider making the burner phone angle slightly harder to immediately connect to E
3. Add more detail to C's manipulation methods so E's jealousy feels fully earned
4. Consider adding small details about victim's planned HR disclosure (found as draft on victim's computer) to make the tragedy more poignant
5. Clarify exactly what physical evidence is presented in the intro vs. what must be discovered through dialogue
