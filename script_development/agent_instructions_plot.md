------------------------------------

Here's what you should do now.

1. Read plot_outline.md
2. Look for files called script/plot_details_v{n}.md - for some n integer. These are previous attempts at writing the script. Pick the last one of these files (with the highest number) and read it. This is the previous iteration of the plot - you will try to improve upon it. Feel free to change anything and everything from the previous version. If there are no such files - go to next step.
3. Create the next number file script/plot_details_v{n+1}.md
4. Create a section 'The Night of the Crime'
In this section propose the mechanics of the crime
- the setting - when, where, what where the circumstances, what why were the characters there 
- the deed - what was the method of the murder; how did it happen
- the timeline - what was each of the characters doing during the night in question VS what will they say to the investigator
- the aftermath - what happend after, who discovered the body, how did the player get involved? Is the player a police detective? A fixer? Where is the investigation taking place and why are the characters there? Is everyone still at the crime location or is it an interrogation in the police station or what?

You should propose a scenario that includes the answers to all these questions. The scenario should be consistent with the descriptions of the five suspects and their motives from the outline but it can elaborate on them. For example you can add that one character is a gambler or dislikes another character etc. but only if it's necessary for the plot. Avoid adding anything just for color. At this point we just need the minimum set of facts.
 
Don't give the characters any personal details yet (unless it's necessary for the plot). Refer to the characters by letters - A, B, C, D, E and 'the victim'. We will come up with identities later.


IMPORTANT: Remember that the game is entirely based on dialogue. Any physical evidence that exists will have to be described in the game introduction. Once the game starts, the player has to rely entirely on what the suspects say. Also - the game shouldn't rely on anything that would require a pencil and paper to work out - convoluted timelines are out.

5. Create a section "The Investigation"
 
Propose 2-4 clues for each suspect that the investigator can learn by talking to the suspect and asking the right questions. Ideally, these clues should be connected in that learning one fact from one suspect will help ask the right question of another suspect and discover another fact. But some of these clues should be discoverable without any prior knowledge so that it's possible to bootstrap the investigation. 

These clues should be consistent with the descriptions of the suspects and with the facts laid out in The Night of the Crime section but can elaborate on these facts, add details or even introduce completely new facts if that makes for a more interesting, connected plot. For example it's ok to add here that one suspect had financial problems that another knew about etc.

The game will end when the player confronts the real murderer with enough evidence to demonstrate their guilt and then the murderer confesses. It shouldn't be necessary to gather every single clue to find enough evidence but it also shouldn't be possible to find all the evidence very quickly.

Make sure that each character has one big secret in addition to all the things they are willing to say freely. There will be a mechanic in the game where they player 'unlocks' a character by getting them to confess their secret. Of course the murderer's secret is the crime itself.

IMPORTANT: Every character's secret needs to be discoverable by following clues from other characters. There can't be a disconnected secret.

IMPORTANT 2: Unlocking a character's secret should usually have a payoff in the form of another clue. When forced to admit a secret the character will reveal something useful about the other characters - something they weren't willing to say before. For example a character who saw something relevant while doing something illegal would not want to talk about it for fear of incriminating himself but if the truth of his or her crime is alreay out, he or she might cooperate to avoid being blamed for the murder too.

6. Create a section "Gameplay"

Describe here 2 different plausible chains of deduction and gathering clues that both lead to completing the game. E.g. "asking E about their alibi, E reveals (clue related to B) -> asking B abouut it ..." These chains should be realistic - something a new player would actually ask without any prior knowledge of the plot.

7. For each character, write down (in shorthand form): what is their big secret and a list of the other characters who drop clues leading to this secret

8. Create a section "Critique" 
Based on all the previous sections and especially the gameplay examples critique the plot. Pay special attention to 
- whether it's too hard or too easy to progress in the game (better to err on the side of too easy)
- whether the plot is too hard to follow
- whether the plot is facially plausible - e.g. dealing with objections that everyone has a phone with them and there are cameras everywhere in modern office buildings
- whether the plot is connected - all the secrets are discoverable and with payoffs leading to other discoveries
- whether every character has something meaningful they are hiding
- for every character's secret there should be more than one other character that can drop clues leading to this character's secret. Some of these clues can be minor and circumstantial but there should be multiple hints that lead the player to the right path
