# Plot Details v3

## The Night of the Crime

### Setting
**When**: Friday night, between 10:30 PM and midnight  
**Where**: Frontier AI headquarters - the "Quiet Room," a soundproofed meeting room on the 4th floor designed for confidential discussions. Unlike the glass-walled conference rooms, this room has solid walls and no windows to the corridor. It was originally an executive meditation space before being converted.

**Why the Quiet Room matters**: The murder happening here explains why no one heard anything. It also creates intrigue about why the victim chose this specific location.

**Circumstances**: Friday marked the completion of Project Prometheus - the victim's breakthrough in AI reasoning capabilities. The company held a celebration on the main floor, with champagne and speeches. Most employees left by 9 PM, but several stayed behind for various reasons - some innocent, some not.

**Why were the characters there?**
- **The Victim**: Stayed to finalize documentation for the board presentation on Monday. Had secretly arranged to meet E in the Quiet Room at 11 PM to discuss finally disclosing their relationship to HR. Chose the Quiet Room specifically because it's private - didn't want anyone walking by and seeing them together before they were ready.
- **A**: Remained after the party under the pretense of congratulating the victim privately. Real reason: to make one final plea about the safety implications of Project Prometheus. A had submitted a formal complaint to the board that very afternoon and felt guilt about potentially destroying the victim's career. Wanted to give the victim a chance to withdraw the project first.
- **B**: Claimed to be working late on their own quarterly review. Actually stayed to copy the victim's Project Prometheus files while the building was nearly empty. The victim had discovered B's espionage earlier that week and given B until Monday to confess.
- **C**: Left the party around 9:15 PM but returned at 10:30 PM, ostensibly to retrieve a charger left at their desk. Real reason: to confess romantic feelings to the victim. C knew the victim would be working late and alone.
- **D**: Left after the party, returned around 10:45 PM claiming they forgot their gym bag. Actually returned out of curiosity after seeing C's car turn back toward the building. D has been quietly observing the workplace drama around the victim.
- **E**: Was not at the party (different department). Secretly came to the building around 11:15 PM for the planned meeting with the victim. E entered through the underground parking garage - senior executives have access to a separate entrance.

### The Deed
**Method**: Strangulation with the victim's own necktie. The tie was partially loosened after, suggesting the killer may have had a moment of regret or wanted to check for signs of life. No murder weapon to trace.

**Why strangulation**: This is a crime of passion - intimate, face-to-face, requiring sustained contact. It takes time, which speaks to the killer's emotional state. It's also personal - this wasn't a quick, clean killing but one driven by overwhelming emotion.

**How it happened**: 
E arrived at 11:15 PM, entering through the executive parking garage. E's keycard logged entry but the exit gate is automatic and doesn't log departures (a known quirk of the older parking system). E knew exactly where to find the victim - they had texted to confirm the meeting location.

For weeks, E had been tormented by C's manipulation campaign: suggestive emails between C and the victim ("Looking forward to our late night - just us"), C's possessive body language at meetings, the way C would touch the victim's shoulder and lean in close. E had seen one of C's emails on the victim's laptop and confronted the victim about it. The victim dismissed E's concerns as paranoia, insisting C was just an overly friendly boss.

That night, E came intending to have "the conversation" - either the victim would commit to going public with their relationship, proving their love, or E would end things. E had convinced themselves this was an ultimatum about commitment, but underneath was the volcanic jealousy that had been building for months.

The conversation started well. The victim was excited, showing E a draft HR disclosure form naming E as their romantic partner. "I want us to stop hiding," the victim said. But then E brought up C again. The victim sighed, said E was being irrational, and made a dismissive comment: "C? That's honestly laughable. C is like a weird aunt to me."

Something about the dismissiveness - the casual way the victim brushed aside E's pain - ignited E's rage. All those months of watching C paw at the victim, all those late-night emails, and now the victim was acting like E was crazy for noticing? E's hands went to the victim's throat. The victim fought back but E was stronger, and E was in a dissociative rage.

When it was over, E stood frozen for several minutes. Then E closed the victim's laptop (never seeing the full disclosure form), straightened the room as best they could, and fled via the back stairs to the parking garage. E drove home and has been in psychological shock ever since.

### The Aftermath
**Discovery**: The building manager discovered the body Saturday morning at 6:30 AM. A tenant had complained about heating in that section overnight, and the manager was checking the Quiet Room's thermostat. Police were called immediately.

**Investigation setting**: The investigation takes place Monday morning at Frontier AI headquarters. The player is a detective with the Homicide Division. The company's CEO has provided a conference room for interviews and requested discretion - a murder at a frontier AI lab would be devastating publicity. All five suspects have been asked to remain available.

**Physical Evidence (Available at Start)**:

1. **Badge access logs**:
   - A: entered 2 PM (normal workday), entered party at 6 PM, exited 10:00 PM
   - B: entered 8 AM (normal workday), still logged as in building at 11:45 PM (exit log shows 11:47 PM)
   - C: entered 8 AM, exited party 9:15 PM, re-entered 10:30 PM, exited 10:50 PM
   - D: entered 8 AM, exited party 9:10 PM, re-entered 10:55 PM, exited 11:05 PM
   - E: No record on main building system that evening
   - *Note*: Executive parking garage has separate logging accessible only through security request

2. **The victim's phone**: Last text sent at 10:55 PM: "Here. Door's open. Can't wait. ❤️" - sent to an unsaved number that traces to a prepaid phone (registered anonymously, paid in cash - common for people having affairs)

3. **The victim's laptop**: Found closed on the Quiet Room table. IT has accessed it - shows a half-completed HR "Relationship Disclosure Form" with E's name filled in. Also contains several emails from C with unusually personal language.

4. **An email printout on victim's desk (in their office, not the Quiet Room)**: From C, dated Wednesday: "Working late tonight? I'll be here. Always makes my night better when you're around. - C" 

5. **Victim's calendar**: Shows several late-night meetings with C over the past two months, always vague titles like "Strategy sync" or "Project discussion"

6. **The necktie**: The victim's own tie, found loosened around their neck. Dark blue silk, no foreign DNA (killer wore gloves or has no DNA in the database - actually E was careful not to leave traces)

## The Investigation

### Clues from Suspect A (Senior Researcher - Safety Concerns)

**Freely shared:**
1. A attended the party and congratulated the victim on Project Prometheus
2. A has publicly disagreed with the victim about AI safety protocols
3. A mentions that B seemed distracted at the party - kept stepping away to take calls
4. A notes that "a lot of people had complicated feelings about the victim" - hints at workplace tensions without specifics

**Discoverable with probing:**
5. A's departure time doesn't match badge logs - claims 9:45, badge shows 10:00. Where were those 15 extra minutes?
6. A knows the victim discovered something about B recently - overheard the victim saying "I can't believe B would do this to the company"
7. When pressed about the victim's safety concerns, A becomes defensive - there's something A isn't saying about their professional conflict

**Big Secret:** A submitted a formal complaint to the board Friday afternoon - just hours before the murder - accusing the victim of reckless endangerment in AI development. The complaint was detailed and damning; if acted upon, it would have ended the victim's career and possibly led to industry blacklisting. A feels crushing guilt: they tried to destroy the victim professionally, and now the victim is dead. A fears this makes them look like they escalated from professional destruction to physical violence.

**Unlocking payoff:** When confronted with evidence of the complaint (C may have heard rumors; board communications aren't fully confidential), A breaks down: "I was trying to do the right thing! The research was dangerous - I still believe that. But that's not why I lied about when I left. I stayed in the parking garage for fifteen minutes, sitting in my car. I was working up the nerve to go back and apologize, to warn the victim what I'd done, give them a chance to respond before the board meeting. While I was sitting there, around 10:45 or 10:50, I saw C almost running to their car. C looked devastated - like they'd just received the worst news of their life. I should have said something to the police right away, but I didn't want to explain what I was still doing there. I'm not proud of any of this."

---

### Clues from Suspect B (Mid-level Researcher - Corporate Spy)

**Freely shared:**
1. B was finishing quarterly documentation and left late - around 11:30 PM
2. B heard someone walking in the hallway around 11 PM - assumed it was cleaning staff
3. B mentions the victim was well-liked but "rubbed some people the wrong way" - vague gossip without specifics
4. B notes that D has "an unhealthy interest" in office gossip

**Discoverable with probing:**
5. B claims to have been at their desk on the 3rd floor, but the Quiet Room and victim's office are on the 4th floor. B somehow knows the victim was using the Quiet Room that night - how?
6. B becomes nervous when asked about their relationship with the victim. There was a recent confrontation.
7. B left at 11:47 PM according to badge logs, not "around 11:30" - what was B doing for those extra 17 minutes?

**Big Secret:** B is a corporate spy working for Nexus Labs, Frontier AI's main competitor. B has been systematically copying research for eighteen months. Two weeks ago, the victim discovered anomalies in the file access logs and confronted B on Wednesday. The victim gave B until Monday to confess to HR, or the victim would report B themselves. B spent Friday night making final copies of Project Prometheus data, expecting to flee the company over the weekend. B is now trapped - they can't leave without looking guilty of murder, but staying risks their espionage being discovered.

**Unlocking payoff:** When exposed as the spy (through A's overheard comment about B "betraying the company," or caught in the lie about their location), B becomes cooperatively desperate: "I'll tell you everything, just please believe me - I didn't kill anyone. I was a spy, yes. The victim caught me. But I was copying files, not committing murder. Here's what I actually saw: I went to the victim's office around 10:15 to get files while they were at the party. But the office was empty. I looked around and spotted the victim entering the Quiet Room down the hall at around 10:20, carrying their laptop. I figured they needed privacy. Later, around 10:35, I saw C going into the Quiet Room. C came out maybe fifteen minutes later looking absolutely wrecked. And here's the important thing: when I finally left around 11:45, I walked past the Quiet Room. The light was off. I assumed the victim had gone home. But if the body was found there in the morning... someone went in after I saw C leave."

### Clues from Suspect C (Department Head - Manipulator)

**Freely shared:**
1. C came back for a charger they left at their desk
2. C saw the victim briefly and they exchanged a few words
3. C casually mentions that the victim seemed to be dating someone - always rushing off, secretive phone calls, that sort of thing
4. C expresses concern that E seems to be taking the death particularly hard - "barely holding it together in our department meetings"

**Discoverable with probing:**
5. C's charger was at their own desk, but C went to the Quiet Room where the victim was. Why?
6. The emails between C and the victim have an unusually personal tone. C claims this is normal "mentorship" language.
7. C knows oddly specific things about E's emotional state and schedule - "management awareness" seems like a thin excuse
8. C left looking "upset" according to D and A - what happened in that room?

**Big Secret:** C has been in love with the victim for over a year and has been systematically manipulating the situation. Knowing the victim was secretly seeing someone (C figured out it was E through careful observation), C launched a campaign to appear as though they were having an affair with the victim. C scheduled unnecessary late-night meetings, wrote emails with romantic undertones, made sure to be physically affectionate with the victim when E might be watching. C's goal was to make E so jealous that E would end the relationship, freeing the victim for C. C never intended for anyone to get hurt - they were playing a long game, expecting the relationship to simply dissolve. C is morally responsible for creating E's murderous jealousy but didn't commit the physical act.

**Unlocking payoff:** When confronted with the pattern of manipulation (D's observations of possessive behavior, E's eventual admission of what drove their jealousy, the suspicious emails), C's composure finally breaks: "I loved them. For a year, I loved them, and they never saw me. They saw me as a mentor, a friendly boss. I thought if I could just remove E from the equation... I never meant for this. That night, I went to the Quiet Room to finally tell the victim how I felt. I thought maybe, with E out of the picture eventually, they might see me differently. But the victim looked at me like I was speaking another language. They said they were flattered, but they were in love with someone else. They were so gentle about it, so kind, which somehow made it worse. They asked me to leave because they were expecting someone. Someone they loved. It must have been E. Oh god, my games - all those emails, the late nights I manufactured - E must have seen them. Did I... did I make E think... I need you to understand: the victim was completely alive when I left. They were happy. They were excited to see whoever was coming. It was E. It had to be E. And E killed them because of what I made E believe."

### Clues from Suspect D (Peer Researcher - Observer/Saboteur)

**Freely shared:**
1. D came back for a gym bag left in the break room
2. D saw the light on under the Quiet Room door, heard someone talking inside in a warm tone
3. D mentions there's been "a lot of weird energy" in the office lately but tries to play neutral
4. D casually notes that C always seemed "very invested" in the victim's wellbeing

**Discoverable with probing:**
5. D actually came back because they saw C's car turning back toward the building - D is curious by nature and wanted to know what was going on
6. D has seen C acting possessively toward the victim for months - touching their arm, interrupting conversations, sending late-night emails. D assumed C had a crush but didn't think it was "their business"
7. D overheard the victim on the phone saying something like "I can't wait either" - sounded romantic, possibly even said "I love you"
8. D has suspicions about who the victim was secretly seeing

**Big Secret:** D has been engaging in petty workplace sabotage against the victim for months out of professional jealousy. D "accidentally" deleted meeting invites from the victim's calendar, "forgot" to forward important messages, and spread subtle rumors questioning the victim's originality ("I heard the real breakthrough came from another team"). D is deeply ashamed - this pettiness looks pathological in light of the murder. D fears the detective will think someone capable of sustained sabotage might also be capable of violence.

**Unlocking payoff:** When confronted with the sabotage (B noticed calendar tampering through the shared system; A might mention the victim complained about mysteriously missing meetings; C notes the victim seemed frustrated about "communication breakdowns"), D is mortified but opens up completely: "It's humiliating, okay? I was jealous. The victim came in two years after me and was already being celebrated while I was invisible. So yes, I was petty. I deleted some meetings. I spread some rumors. But I would never hurt anyone. Look, I'll tell you everything I noticed: I've thought the victim was secretly seeing E for about two months now. I saw them leaving together one evening, getting into E's car, and the body language was obvious - they were together. And that night, when I walked past the Quiet Room around 11, I heard the victim on the phone. They sounded so happy, and they definitely said 'I love you' before hanging up. I know it's not proof of anything, but... if E was the secret relationship, and C was trying to interfere... that's a volatile combination."

---

### Clues from Suspect E (Senior Executive - The Murderer)

**Freely shared:**
1. E wasn't at the party - different department, different celebration schedule
2. E was home all evening, watching television
3. E expresses appropriate professional grief - "a terrible loss to the company, such a brilliant mind"
4. E mentions knowing the victim professionally through cross-department projects

**Discoverable with probing:**
5. E's alibi is unverifiable - lives alone, no doorbell camera, didn't order food or talk to anyone
6. E becomes noticeably uncomfortable when the victim's personal life is mentioned
7. E knows specific details about C's meetings with the victim - dates, times, that they were often "just the two of them" - knowledge that doesn't fit E's claimed casual professional relationship
8. E has access to the executive parking garage, which has its own entry system
9. E's demeanor shifts subtly when asked about whether the victim was seeing anyone - a flash of something painful before the mask returns

**Big Secret:** E killed the victim in a jealous rage. E and the victim had been secretly together for eight months, hiding the relationship due to E's senior position and company policy complications. E had become increasingly consumed by jealousy due to C's manipulation - the emails, the late meetings, C's physical affection toward the victim. E went to the Quiet Room that night planning to demand the victim choose between E and C. When the victim denied any romantic involvement with C (truthfully), E's paranoid mind interpreted this as gaslighting. The murder wasn't planned; it erupted from eight months of bottled suspicion and C's manufactured "evidence."

**Unlocking payoff:** E's confession comes in stages:

*Stage 1* - When confronted with evidence of the romantic relationship (D's observation of them leaving together, D hearing the victim say "I love you" on the phone, the text to the prepaid phone, the HR disclosure form with E's name):
E admits the relationship: "Fine. Yes, we were together. Eight months. The victim wanted to keep it quiet because of my position, company optics, all of it. I loved them. But I wasn't at the building that night. I was home."

*Stage 2* - When confronted with what drove E's jealousy (C's confession about the manipulation, the emails, the late-night meetings, D's observations of C's possessive behavior):
E's composure cracks: "You don't understand what it was like. Every day, watching C touch them. Finding those emails - 'Just us tonight,' 'Looking forward to seeing you' - what was I supposed to think? The victim kept saying it was nothing, that C was just friendly, but how could I believe that when the evidence was right there?"

*Stage 3* - When confronted with the full evidence (B established the victim was alive when C left; D heard victim alive at 11 PM; E's parking garage entry log at 11:15; no exit log because E left through back stairs; the victim was killed between 11:15 and whenever B walked past at 11:45 and found the light off):
E breaks completely: "I went there to save our relationship. The victim was so happy to see me. They showed me this form - an HR disclosure, with my name on it. They wanted to go public. They said they loved me and only me. And I said, if that's true, why does C act like you're together? Why the secret meetings? The victim laughed. Laughed. Said I was being paranoid, that C was like a 'weird aunt.' Something in me snapped. All those months of watching C paw at them, all the late nights I spent wondering, and now I was paranoid? I grabbed their tie, and I... I don't remember deciding to do it. Just the pressure. Just their face. And then they stopped moving. They were going to choose me. They already had. And I killed them because C made me believe a lie. The victim loved me. Only me. And I murdered them for it."

## Gameplay

### Chain of Deduction 1: Following the Romantic Trail

1. **Opening**: Player reviews evidence. Notes the text message with ❤️ to a prepaid phone, and the HR disclosure form naming E. Curious about E's relationship with the victim.

2. **Interview E about their relationship with victim** → E claims professional only. But E seems too knowledgeable about C's meetings with victim. Flag this inconsistency.

3. **Interview D** → D shares that they noticed "weird energy" in office. When pressed about victim's personal life, D mentions seeing victim and E leaving together in E's car - "body language was obvious."

4. **Return to E with D's observation** → E reluctantly admits to the relationship, but maintains they were home that night.

5. **Interview C** → C seems to know a lot about E. C mentions E is "taking the death very hard." When pressed about their own relationship with victim, C's answers about the emails seem evasive.

6. **Interview D about C** → D reveals C has been acting possessively toward victim for months. Physical touching, interrupting, late-night emails. "I assumed it was an unrequited crush."

7. **Confront C with pattern of possessive behavior** → C's composure cracks. C confesses to the manipulation - manufacturing appearance of affair to break up victim and E. C says victim was alive, waiting excitedly for someone, when C left.

8. **Armed with C's confession, confront E** → Describe C's manipulation campaign. Watch E's reaction - anger, pain, recognition. E begins to realize they were manipulated.

9. **Check E's parking access through security** → E entered executive garage at 11:15 PM. No exit logged.

10. **Final confrontation with E** → Present the complete picture: the manipulation, the timeline (victim alive at 10:50 when C left, dead by 11:45 when B walked past), E's entry at 11:15, E's unverifiable alibi. E confesses.

### Chain of Deduction 2: Following the Timeline

1. **Opening**: Player notes B left very late (11:47 PM badge log). B claims 11:30. That's a 17-minute discrepancy. B also claims to have been on 3rd floor but somehow knows victim was in the Quiet Room.

2. **Interview A** → A mentions B seemed distracted at party. When pressed further, A mentions overhearing victim say something about B "betraying the company."

3. **Confront B about location inconsistency and the accusation** → B, cornered, confesses to being a spy. But in exchange for cooperation: B saw C enter and leave the Quiet Room (10:35-10:50). C left looking "wrecked." And when B left at 11:45, the Quiet Room light was off.

4. **This establishes**: Victim was alive when C left at 10:50. Someone turned off the light (or killed the victim) between 10:50 and 11:45.

5. **Interview D** → D reveals hearing victim on phone around 11:00, sounding happy, saying "I love you." Victim was alive at 11:00.

6. **Narrow the window**: Murder happened between 11:00 (D's observation) and 11:45 (B's observation of light off).

7. **D also reveals** suspicion that victim was secretly dating E (the car sighting).

8. **Review HR disclosure form** → E's name is on it. The victim was about to go public with E.

9. **Interview E about the relationship** → E denies, then admits when confronted with evidence. Claims to be home but can't verify. E knows too much about C's meetings with victim.

10. **Request E's parking garage records** → E entered at 11:15 PM. No exit logged.

11. **Final confrontation** → E was there. E was the person the victim was waiting for. E was jealous of C. E killed the victim in the narrow window between 11:15 and 11:45. E confesses.

## Critique

### Improvements from v2

1. **Changed murder method to strangulation**: More intimate and personal than blunt force trauma - better reflects crime of passion. Also removes the complication of a physical murder weapon that needs to be "wiped clean" (always slightly implausible that no trace remains).

2. **Changed location to "Quiet Room"**: Soundproofed space explains why no one heard anything. Also creates natural intrigue about why victim chose this private location - answer is they were meeting E secretly.

3. **Tightened the timeline**: Clearer windows of observation. D hears victim alive at 11:00. E enters at 11:15. B sees light off at 11:45. Murder window is narrow and damning for E.

4. **Made E's parking garage evidence less immediately available**: Requires specific security request, not automatically in initial evidence package. This prevents the game from being too easy.

5. **Added HR disclosure form to initial evidence**: Gives player E's name early but in a way that requires investigation to understand significance. This is a "Chekhov's gun" that pays off when E's guilt is established.

6. **Improved B's value**: B's confession now provides crucial timeline evidence (light was off at 11:45) that narrows the murder window significantly.

7. **Strengthened D's observation chain**: D now provides both the romantic phone call (victim alive at 11:00) AND the relationship suspicion (seeing victim and E together). This makes D more valuable as an information source.

### Remaining Strengths

1. **Tragic core intact**: E killed their lover based on manufactured jealousy. The victim was about to go public with their love for E. This emotional punch remains powerful.

2. **C's moral responsibility**: C didn't commit murder but is morally responsible. This creates satisfying moral complexity - two people are guilty, in different ways.

3. **Connected clues**: Every secret unlocks through multiple paths. No dead ends.

4. **Escalating revelations**: Each secret revealed provides new information about other characters.

5. **Realistic dialogue hooks**: The gameplay chains use questions a real player would naturally ask ("What were you really doing there?" "Tell me about your relationship with the victim").

### Potential Issues

**1. Difficulty Balance - LOW CONCERN**
- The HR disclosure form with E's name is in initial evidence - could make E too obvious too quickly
- Mitigation: The form only proves E had a relationship with victim, not that E killed them. Still requires building the timeline and motive.
- The parking garage records require a specific request (not automatic) - player must think to ask

**2. Plausibility Issues - VERY LOW CONCERN**
- No witnesses to murder: Soundproofed Quiet Room explains this ✓
- E's parking exit not logged: Established quirk of old system (logs entries, not exits from gate) ✓
- Prepaid phone for affair: Realistic for people hiding relationships ✓
- Why strangle? Crime of passion, E's hands went to victim's throat in rage - no premeditation ✓
- No DNA on tie: E was careful/lucky, or wore gloves (nervous about the confrontation) ✓

**3. Modern Phone Issues - ADDRESSED**
- E's phone location: E could claim phone was home (left it intentionally, or was nervous and forgot it). Or phone was in car in garage the whole time.
- Victim's phone: Text was sent at 10:55, shows victim was alive then. Phone went dark after - likely in Quiet Room where victim was killed.

**4. Every Character's Secret is Meaningful and Connected**
- E: The murder itself
- C: The manipulation that caused the murder - discovering this is essential to understanding WHY E killed
- B: Provides crucial timeline evidence (light off at 11:45)
- A: Provides eyewitness of C leaving devastated
- D: Provides evidence of E's relationship AND that victim was alive at 11:00

**5. Multiple Clue Paths to Each Secret - VERIFIED**
| Secret | Characters/Evidence Providing Clues |
|--------|-------------------------------------|
| A's complaint | C (heard about it), D (noticed hostility), A's timeline lies |
| B's espionage | A (overheard victim), D (notes shady behavior), B's own inconsistencies |
| C's manipulation | D (possessive behavior), A (devastated exit), E (jealousy source), emails |
| D's sabotage | B (calendar tampering), A (missing meetings), C (victim's frustration) |
| E's murder | D (relationship + phone call), C (implicates E), B (timeline), HR form, text, parking logs |

**6. Natural Conversation Starters**
- The HR disclosure form immediately creates questions about E
- C's emails look suspicious and invite inquiry
- B's late departure time is notable
- D returning twice seems odd
- A's timeline doesn't match badge logs
- Multiple natural "hooks" for a player to begin pulling threads

### Final Assessment

Version 3 improves on v2 with a more intimate murder method (strangulation), a better location (soundproofed Quiet Room), and tighter timeline evidence. The difficulty is well-balanced - the HR form gives E's name early, but proving E's guilt requires building the full picture through interviews. The emotional core remains powerful: E killed the person who loved them most, based on a lie manufactured by C's obsession.

The investigation can begin from multiple angles (the romantic trail via the HR form, or the timeline trail via B's inconsistencies) and both lead to the same conclusion through different paths. Every character has a meaningful secret with multiple discovery routes. The plot should play well as an LLM-driven interrogation game.
