# Plot Details v6

## The Night of the Crime

### Setting

**When**: Saturday night, between 11:15 PM and 11:30 PM  
**Where**: C's house - a large home in a quiet suburban neighborhood about 20 minutes from Frontier AI's office. C lives alone in a house inherited from family. It has a main floor (living room, kitchen, dining room), upstairs bedrooms, and a finished basement with a home office/study. No security cameras (C values privacy). The neighbors aren't close enough to see or hear much.

**Why the house party matters**: No corporate security. No badge logs. No cameras. A residential neighborhood where people come and go without being tracked. The murder happens in a private room while a party is winding down.

**Circumstances**: C hosted a house party on Saturday night to celebrate Project Prometheus - the victim's breakthrough in autonomous AI reasoning. C positioned it as a casual "team celebration" but really wanted an excuse to have the victim in C's home, in an intimate setting.

**Who was at the party**: About 25-30 people from Frontier AI - researchers, engineers, product people. A mix of departments and levels. The victim was the guest of honor. **E was there too** - a senior executive attending to show cross-departmental support.

**Why only five suspects**: Around 10:30 PM, the bulk of the party (~20 people) left together to continue celebrating at "The Foundry" - a trendy downtown bar. They stayed at the bar until 2 AM, and the bar has security cameras, credit card receipts, and dozens of witnesses. **Everyone who went to the bar has an iron-clad alibi.**

Five people remained at C's house after 10:30 PM: the victim, A, B, C, and D.

**E left the party early** - around 9:45 PM - after watching C fawn over the victim all evening. C touching the victim's arm, whispering in their ear, making toasts to "our brilliant rising star." For E, this was the final confirmation of everything E had suspected for months. E made an excuse ("early morning tomorrow") and left, visibly upset. Multiple guests saw E leave.

**E's apparent alibi**: E left before the murder, before even most of the other guests. E should be in the clear. But E didn't go home - E drove around for an hour, stewing in jealousy. Then the victim texted: "Where did you go? C is just being C. Come back after the crowd leaves. Tonight we celebrate, remember? ❤️"

E came back around 11 PM, parking down the street and entering through the back gate.

**Why each person stayed behind:**

- **The Victim**: Told others they were "tired" and would head home soon. Real reason: had arranged to meet E after the crowd left. The victim was confused and hurt that E had left early, but hoped E would come back. Had brought champagne and an HR disclosure form to propose going public with their relationship.

- **A**: Stayed because A wanted a private word with the victim. A had submitted a formal safety complaint about Prometheus to the board Friday and felt obligated to warn the victim before Monday. A was waiting for the crowd to thin out.

- **B**: Stayed because B couldn't risk leaving. B is a corporate spy who the victim caught three days ago. The victim gave B until Monday to confess or be reported. B was terrified and didn't want to let the victim out of sight - also couldn't go to a bar and act normal around coworkers.

- **C**: It's C's house. C also wanted time alone with the victim after the other guests left. C planned to finally confess romantic feelings. C was riding high after a night of manufactured closeness with the victim.

- **D**: Stayed because D noticed that A, B, and C were all lingering suspiciously. D is a chronic gossip who sensed drama and didn't want to miss it. Also, D resents the victim and wanted to see if something embarrassing might happen.

- **E**: Came back around 11 PM after receiving the victim's text. Parked down the street and entered through the back gate to avoid being seen. E was supposed to meet the victim in the basement study. E was still consumed by jealousy - the text dismissing C as "just being C" felt like gaslighting.

### The Murder Location

C's house has a finished basement with a home office/study - a quiet, private room with a couch, desk, and bookshelves. The victim retreated there around 10:45 PM, ostensibly to "make a work call" but really to wait for E. The basement is soundproofed (C had it done for home office calls) and has a back door leading to the yard - so E could enter without being seen by anyone upstairs.

### The Deed

**Method**: Strangulation with the victim's burgundy silk scarf - a signature accessory worn to important occasions. The scarf was found loosened around the neck.

**Why strangulation**: No premeditation. No weapon brought. An explosion of rage using whatever was at hand. The intimate nature speaks to deep personal emotion.

**How it happened**:

E entered through the basement back door around 11:10 PM. The evening had been torture - watching C touch the victim constantly, whisper in their ear, act like they owned them. E had left at 9:45, unable to take any more. But then the victim texted, dismissing E's concerns ("C is just being C") and asking E to come back. Part of E wanted to believe it. Part of E was furious at being made to feel crazy.

The victim smiled when E entered. "You made it. I was worried you'd changed your mind." The victim gestured to a bottle of champagne and an HR Relationship Disclosure Form on the desk. "After tonight, no more hiding. I want to tell everyone."

E stared at the disclosure form. "You're serious? After everything with C?"

"C?" The victim looked confused. "What about C? This is C's house, obviously C is here. What does that have to do with us?"

"The emails. The private meetings. This whole party. You can't tell me nothing is going on."

The victim sighed with what sounded like exasperation. "E, we've been over this. C is just... like that. Overly friendly. I've never given C any encouragement. You're being paranoid."

That word - *paranoid* - after months of watching, cataloguing evidence, suffering in silence. E's hands found the scarf before conscious thought. The victim's expression shifted from annoyance to confusion to fear. Then nothing.

E stood frozen for several minutes. Then, mechanically, E turned off the study light, exited through the basement back door, walked through the yard to the back gate, and drove home. E spent Sunday in a dissociative haze.

### The Aftermath

**Discovery**: C found the body Sunday morning at 10 AM while cleaning up from the party. The victim was on the floor of the basement study, the burgundy scarf loosely around their neck. The back door was unlocked. A champagne bottle and two glasses sat on the desk, along with papers.

**Why only these five are suspects**: Police quickly established that everyone who went to The Foundry bar has an alibi - security footage, credit card receipts, witness statements. That narrows it to people who were at C's house after 10:30 PM.

**E's apparent alibi**: E was at the party but left early - around 9:45 PM - and multiple guests saw E leave. E should be cleared. But E didn't actually go home; E came back.

**Investigation Setting**: The investigation takes place Monday at Frontier AI headquarters. The player is a homicide detective. Local police secured the scene Sunday but interviews are conducted at the company. 

Initially, the suspects are A, B, C, and D (the people who stayed). E appears to have left before the murder and isn't an immediate suspect.

**How E becomes a suspect**: 
- The victim's phone shows loving texts to an unsaved number - including one sent at 10:25 PM asking someone to "come back"
- The texts suggest whoever left was asked to return ("C is just being C. Come back after everyone leaves")
- E left the party upset around 9:45 PM - the timing matches
- C, when pressed, reveals knowing about the victim's secret relationship with E
- B, when their espionage is exposed, finally admits seeing E enter and exit through the back gate
- E's alibi ("went straight home") can't be verified - E lives alone

E initially seems cleared but becomes the prime suspect as evidence accumulates.

**Physical Evidence (Available at Start)**:

1. **No cameras**: C's house has no security system. The neighborhood is quiet and residential.

2. **The Alibi Wall**: Everyone who went to The Foundry bar (~20 people) is cleared. Security footage, credit cards, witnesses. This is established fact.

3. **Victim's Phone** (dead, found in basement): Last text sent Saturday 10:40 PM to an unsaved number: "Most people leaving for bar now. Come to basement door in 30 min. Tonight we celebrate ❤️"

4. **The Champagne**: Expensive bottle, unopened. Two glasses set out. The victim was expecting someone.

5. **HR Disclosure Form** (found on desk): A relationship disclosure form with the victim's information filled in. The partner section is blank - it looks like the victim was planning to fill it out together with someone.

6. **The Burgundy Scarf**: Found loosely around victim's neck. No foreign DNA recovered.

7. **Back Door Unlocked**: The basement's back door was unlocked. Someone could have entered or exited without going through the main house.

8. **C's "Romantic" Email** (printed, found in victim's bag): From C, dated last Wednesday: "Can't wait for Saturday. My place, just us after everyone leaves? —C". Victim's handwritten note in margin: "NO. C is getting weird. Talk to [scribbled out] about this."

9. **Initial Statements**:
   - A: "Left around 11:45 PM. The victim was still there when I left, said they were making calls downstairs."
   - B: "Went to bed in the guest room around 11:30. Didn't hear anything."
   - C: "Went to sleep around 11. Thought the victim had left or was sleeping in the guest room."
   - D: "Left around 11:50. The victim was downstairs, I assumed on a call."
   - E: (not yet interviewed - becomes suspect later)

## The Investigation

### Clues from Suspect A (Senior Researcher - Safety Advocate)

**Freely shared:**
1. Left the party around 11:45 PM
2. Has had professional disagreements with the victim about AI safety
3. B seemed "anxious" all night - not acting normal
4. The victim was distracted at the party - kept checking phone

**Discoverable with probing:**
5. A didn't just "say goodnight" - A had a private conversation with the victim around 10:35. What about?
6. A has been documenting concerns about Prometheus for months
7. A overheard the victim say "I can't keep hiding this from everyone" on a call last week
8. A noticed C was "hovering" around the victim all night

**Big Secret**: A submitted a safety complaint about Prometheus to the board on Friday. The complaint could destroy the victim's career. A stayed late at the party to warn the victim privately before Monday. The conversation in the kitchen was tense - the victim seemed distracted and asked A to leave them alone because they were "expecting someone." A left around 11:45 with the victim still alive (downstairs, supposedly on a call).

**Unlocking Payoff**: When confronted with the complaint (C was CC'd; B saw it in systems), A admits: "I tried to warn them. Prometheus is dangerous and they wouldn't listen. But when I talked to them, they barely paid attention - kept looking at their phone, said they were expecting someone. I saw C go downstairs after the victim, and C came back up looking devastated. Later, around 11, I was getting water and saw someone slip in through the back gate - I assumed it was a late party guest. The victim was clearly waiting for someone. It wasn't any of us."

---

### Clues from Suspect B (Mid-level Researcher - Corporate Spy)

**Freely shared:**
1. Stayed late, had a headache, crashed in the guest room
2. Didn't see or hear anything unusual
3. The victim "made enemies" - vague
4. D "watches everything" - always lurking
5. E left the party early - "seemed upset about something"

**Discoverable with probing:**
6. B claims to have been inside all evening, but D saw B go out to the back porch around 11 PM
7. B was unusually nervous all week - colleagues noticed
8. The victim had some kind of confrontation with B recently
9. B accessed company systems suspiciously in the days before the party
10. When asked what B was doing on the back porch, B becomes evasive

**Big Secret**: B is a corporate spy for Nexus Labs. The victim caught B three days ago and gave B until Monday to confess. B couldn't leave the party - needed to stay close to the victim, couldn't act normal at a bar. Around 11:05 PM, B went to the back porch to make a call to their handler at Nexus - panicking about the Monday deadline. While on the porch, B saw E enter through the back gate. B recognized E immediately. Then around 11:32, B saw E leave through the same gate, walking quickly. B didn't say anything because admitting to being on the porch means explaining the phone call - which would expose the espionage.

**What B knows but won't say (until espionage is exposed)**:
- B saw E enter through the back gate around 11:08 PM
- B saw E leave through the back gate around 11:32 PM
- E looked "determined" going in and "shaken" coming out

**Unlocking Payoff**: When B's espionage is exposed (A heard victim sounding "betrayed"; D noticed paranoid behavior; HR meeting on victim's Monday calendar), B finally reveals what they saw: "Fine. I'm a spy. The victim caught me and I was terrified. But I didn't kill anyone. The reason I didn't tell you what I saw is because I was on the back porch making a call I shouldn't have been making. And while I was out there, I saw E. E came in through the back gate around 11:08 - I checked the time because I was on the phone. E went straight to the basement door. Then around 11:30, I saw E leave the same way. E looked... different. Shaken. E practically ran to the gate. I didn't think much of it at the time - I assumed E and the victim had some kind of fight. But now... E was the last person to see the victim alive."

### Clues from Suspect C (Department Head - Manipulator)

**Freely shared:**
1. Hosted the party to celebrate the team
2. The victim went to the basement to make a work call
3. Checked on the victim briefly, they were fine
4. E has been "very affected" by the death - strange for a casual colleague

**Discoverable with probing:**
5. C was gone for 15+ minutes when "checking on" the victim. What really happened?
6. C came back upstairs looking upset - B and D both noticed
7. The email in the victim's bag has a romantic tone
8. C knows suspicious details about E and the victim

**Big Secret**: C has been obsessively in love with the victim for over a year. C discovered the victim was secretly seeing E (noticed patterns, overheard a call) and launched a manipulation campaign - suggestive emails, manufactured proximity, possessive body language when E was watching. C organized this party specifically to have the victim in C's home. When C went to the basement at 10:50, C confessed everything. The victim was kind but firm: they loved someone else. C left devastated. The victim was alive when C went back upstairs.

**Unlocking Payoff**: When confronted (D's observations, A mentioning C's hovering, the emails, E's later description of jealousy), C breaks: "I loved them. For a year. I knew about E - I'd watched them together. I thought if E got jealous enough... That night I finally told the victim how I felt. They said they were in love with someone else - E - and they were going public soon. They asked me to leave because E was coming over. E was coming to my house, to be with them. And everything I did to make E jealous... I didn't know it would lead to this."

---

### Clues from Suspect D (Peer Researcher - Observer)

**Freely shared:**
1. Stayed late because a friend was driving them home and was running late
2. Just hung around, had some drinks, nothing unusual
3. C is "obviously infatuated" with the victim
4. There was "tension" at the party - people noticed

**Discoverable with probing:**
5. D's "friend" story doesn't check out - D drove themselves
6. D saw someone enter through the back gate around 11 PM
7. D has been unusually interested in the victim's personal life
8. D noticed things about the victim's relationships others missed

**Big Secret**: D stayed because D is a chronic snoop who resented the victim's success. D has engaged in petty sabotage for months and sent the anonymous tip that triggered A's safety investigation. That night, D stayed because D sensed drama. Around 11 PM, D was in the kitchen and saw someone slip in through the back gate. D didn't recognize them in the dark but suspected it might be E - D had long suspected the victim was secretly seeing E.

**Unlocking Payoff**: When confronted (B noticed the sabotage; A got an anonymous tip with insider details; C mentioned victim's frustration), D admits: "Fine, I'm a jealous snoop. The victim got everything and I got nothing. I stayed because I wanted to see what would happen. C was acting desperate, A was acting guilty, B was acting paranoid. And around 11, I saw someone come in through the back gate. I couldn't see their face - it was dark - but they moved like they knew exactly where they were going. Headed straight for the basement door. I've thought for months the victim was secretly seeing E. If that was E..."

---

### Clues from Suspect E (Senior Executive - The Murderer)

**Note**: E has an apparent alibi - E was at the party but left early (9:45 PM), before the murder. Multiple guests saw E leave. E is initially interviewed as a witness, not a suspect.

**Freely shared:**
1. Was at the party but left early - "had an early morning"
2. The victim seemed to be having a good time when E left
3. Expresses appropriate professional grief
4. Knew the victim through cross-departmental work

**Discoverable with probing:**
5. E seemed upset when leaving - not like someone with "an early morning"
6. E becomes uncomfortable when asked about the victim's personal life
7. E knows specific details about C's behavior toward the victim - too specific for casual observation
8. When asked about the victim's text at 10:25 ("come back after everyone leaves"), E's composure cracks
9. E claims to have gone straight home, but E lives alone - no one can verify

**Big Secret**: E killed the victim. E and the victim had been secretly together for eight months. E was at the party but couldn't stand watching C fawn over the victim all evening. E left at 9:45 PM in a jealous rage. Then the victim texted asking E to come back. E returned around 11 PM, entering through the back gate. When the victim dismissed E's jealousy as "paranoia," something snapped.

**Unlocking Payoff** (staged):

*Stage 1 - The Relationship*: When confronted with evidence (the texts asking someone to "come back," C's revelation about the relationship, E's emotional reaction):
E admits: "Yes. We were together. Eight months. We hid it because of my position. I loved them. But I left the party early and went home. I wasn't there when it happened."

*Stage 2 - Breaking the Alibi*: When confronted with the victim's text asking E to "come back" and E's lack of verifiable alibi:
E falters: "They texted me after I left. Asked me to come back. But I didn't. I was too angry. I went home."

*Stage 3 - The Witness*: When confronted with B's testimony (B saw E enter through the back gate at 11:08 PM and leave at 11:32 PM):
E's alibi collapses: "B saw me? I... I didn't think anyone..."

*Stage 4 - The Confession*: When confronted with complete evidence (B's eyewitness account, C confirming victim expected E, the disclosure form and champagne were for E):
E breaks: "I couldn't take it anymore. Watching C paw at them all night. I left, but then they texted - 'C is just being C.' Like I was crazy. Like months of watching C seduce them was nothing. So I went back. And they were so happy to see me. Champagne. The disclosure form. They wanted to go public. But when I asked about C, they said I was being paranoid. That word. After everything. I grabbed the scarf. They looked confused, then scared, then... nothing. They were choosing me. They loved me. And I killed them because C made me believe a lie."

## Gameplay

### Chain of Deduction 1: Following the Romance

1. **Opening**: Review evidence. Victim's text at 10:25 PM asked someone to "come back" with "Tonight we celebrate ❤️". Champagne and blank disclosure form at the scene. Someone left early and was asked to return.

2. **Note**: E left the party at 9:45 PM, upset. Multiple guests saw this. E claims to have gone straight home.

3. **Interview E** (as witness) → E says they left early and went home. But E knows detailed information about C's behavior at the party - suspiciously detailed for someone who "left early."

4. **Interview C** → C mentions E left "looking upset." When pressed about the romantic emails, C deflects. E is "taking the death very hard."

5. **Connect the dots**: E left upset. The victim texted someone asking them to "come back." The timing matches.

6. **Press C** about the relationship → C breaks, reveals obsession and manipulation campaign. Confirms victim was secretly with E and expected E to return that night.

7. **Return to E** → E admits the relationship but maintains alibi: "I didn't go back. I went home."

8. **Key obstacle**: E has an apparent alibi. Need to prove E returned.

9. **Expose B's espionage** (through clues from A, D, HR meeting) → B finally cooperates and reveals: saw E enter through the back gate at 11:08 PM, saw E leave at 11:32 PM.

10. **Final confrontation** → B's testimony breaks E's alibi. E confesses.

### Chain of Deduction 2: Following the Lies

1. **Opening**: Everyone has inconsistent stories. B claims "inside all evening" but D saw B on the porch. A had a "private conversation." C went downstairs for "15 minutes."

2. **Interview D** → D admits snooping. Saw C leave basement crying. Saw B on the back porch around 11 PM. Saw someone enter through back gate - suspects E.

3. **Confront B** about being on the porch → B becomes evasive. Why won't B explain?

4. **Interview A** → A admits safety complaint conversation. Victim was "expecting someone."

5. **Expose B's espionage** (A heard victim "betrayed," D noticed paranoid behavior, HR meeting Monday) → B's secret is out.

6. **B cooperates** → "I was making a call I shouldn't have. While I was on the porch, I saw E come in through the back gate at 11:08. Then E left around 11:30, looking shaken."

7. **Confront E** → B's eyewitness testimony. E's alibi collapses. E confesses.

## Critique

### Changes from previous versions

1. **House party setting**: Natural, relatable, no weird corporate retreat dynamics.

2. **Simple alibi elimination**: ~20 people went to a bar together. Security cameras + credit cards + witnesses = iron-clad alibis. Only people who stayed are suspects.

3. **E was at the party**: E attended, saw C fawning over the victim, left upset at 9:45 PM. This gives E an *apparent* alibi - E left before the murder happened. Multiple guests saw E leave.

4. **E returned secretly**: The victim texted E asking them to "come back." E returned around 11 PM, entering through the back gate. Breaking E's alibi is the core challenge.

5. **B is the key witness**: B saw E enter and leave through the back gate. But B won't reveal this because B was on the porch making a call to their spy handler. Exposing B's espionage unlocks the crucial testimony that breaks E's alibi.

6. **Interlocking secrets**: You can't prove E did it without B's testimony. You can't get B's testimony without exposing B's espionage. This creates satisfying investigative dependencies.

### Strengths

1. **No camera problem**: Private residence, no security system. Solved.

2. **Clear alibi logic**: Bar group is cleared. Only people at the house are suspects. Simple.

3. **E has an apparent alibi**: E left the party early - multiple witnesses saw this. Breaking E's alibi requires investigation.

4. **Natural party dynamics**: Big party, people leaving for a bar, some staying behind - all realistic.

5. **B is the key to solving the case**: B saw E enter and leave. But B won't talk until B's espionage is exposed. This creates a satisfying investigative chain.

6. **Each stayer has a reason**: A wants private talk. B can't face a bar. C is the host. D is a snoop. All believable.

### Potential Issues and Mitigations

**1. Why would E come back after leaving upset?**
- The victim texted asking E to return ("C is just being C. Come back.")
- E was torn between jealousy and wanting to believe the victim
- The victim promised "tonight we celebrate" - the disclosure form, going public
- E's return is emotionally motivated, not fully rational

**2. Why didn't anyone else see E return?**
- E entered through the back gate, not the front door
- Most remaining guests were in the living room or kitchen, not watching the back yard
- D glimpsed someone but couldn't identify them in the dark
- Only B had a clear view (from the back porch) and recognized E

**3. Why won't B just tell the police what they saw?**
- B was on the porch making a call to their spy handler at Nexus Labs
- If B admits to seeing E, B has to explain why B was outside at that time
- B's alibi ("inside all evening") is a lie designed to hide the espionage
- Once the espionage is exposed, B has no reason to protect E and cooperates

**4. Why blank disclosure form?**
- Victim wanted to fill it out together with E as a romantic gesture
- Removes the "E is obviously the killer" problem

**5. Every secret is meaningful**

| Character | Secret | Why It Matters |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| E | Murder | The crime itself |
| C | Manipulation | Explains WHY E killed; reveals E as the lover |
| B | Espionage | **THE KEY** - B is the eyewitness who breaks E's alibi |
| A | Safety complaint | Provides timeline context |
| D | Sabotage | Saw someone at back gate; helps establish E as suspect |

**6. Multiple paths to each secret**

| Secret | Discovery Routes |
|--------|-----------------|
| A's complaint | C (CC'd), B (systems), D (sent tip) |
| B's espionage | A (victim's betrayal), D (saw B on porch), HR meeting Monday |
| C's manipulation | D (behavior), A (hovering), B (saw C upset), emails |
| D's sabotage | B (system logs), A (tip details), false alibi |
| E's murder | B (eyewitness - the crucial proof), C (reveals relationship), D (suspected E), victim's texts |

**7. The investigative chain**

The player cannot convict E without B's testimony → B won't give testimony while hiding espionage → exposing B's espionage requires combining clues from A, D, and physical evidence → this creates a satisfying multi-step investigation

### Final Assessment

This version creates a tighter mystery:
- E has an apparent alibi (left early) that must be broken
- B is the key witness but won't talk until B's own secret is exposed
- The interlocking secrets create genuine investigative challenge
- The solution requires connecting multiple threads, not just finding one smoking gun

The emotional payoff remains devastating: E killed the person who loved them, based on jealousy C manufactured, and returned that night because the victim asked them to.
