# Death at the Frontier - Plot Details

## The Night of the Crime

### The Setting
**When**: Thursday night into early Friday morning, between 11:00 PM and 1:00 AM
**Where**: The victim's home - a small house in a residential neighborhood, 15 minutes from the Frontier AI campus

**The Circumstances**:
The victim was hosting an informal evening at home. Earlier that week, the victim had announced to close colleagues that they had achieved a major breakthrough in their research and wanted to celebrate with the team before presenting it to leadership on Friday afternoon. The victim invited the core research team and key stakeholders over for drinks and conversation on Thursday evening, starting at 8 PM.

This was typical of the victim - charismatic, eager to share success, and comfortable blurring professional and social boundaries. By 10:30 PM, most guests had left, but a few remained or returned later for various reasons.

**Why the characters were there**:
- **Victim**: Hosting the celebration, excited about the breakthrough and upcoming presentation
- **Suspect A**: Attended the party, left with most guests around 10:30 PM. Earlier that day (Thursday afternoon), the victim had confronted A about discovering A's secret leaking campaign. A returned around 12:10 AM to make one last appeal for the victim to stay quiet, but saw suspicious activity (E's car, someone lurking) and left without approaching.
- **Suspect B**: Attended the party, left around 10:15 PM, returned around 12:12 AM claiming to have forgotten their jacket, but actually hoping to access the victim's home computer
- **Suspect C**: Attended the party, was the last "official" guest, left around 11:00 PM after helping the victim clean up
- **Suspect D**: Attended the party, left around 10:00 PM and went home
- **Suspect E**: Attended the party briefly but left early around 9:30 PM, claiming a headache, but actually unable to bear watching C and the victim together; returned around 11:45 PM

### The Deed
**Method**: Strangulation followed by staging to look like a fall

**How it happened**: 
E returned at 11:45 PM and found the victim alone in the home office, reviewing slides for Friday's presentation. E had been consumed by jealousy all evening - watching C and the victim laughing together, C's hand on the victim's shoulder, the intimate way C spoke about "our breakthrough." E came back to confront the victim, to demand the truth about C.

The victim was genuinely confused by E's accusations. There was nothing with C - just a good working relationship. But E had been poisoned by weeks of C's manipulation and couldn't believe it. The argument escalated. E grabbed the victim by the throat, initially just to make them listen, to stop the denials. But rage took over. E strangled the victim until they stopped moving.

In panic, E dragged the victim's body to the top of the basement stairs and pushed it down, then knocked over a small table to make it look like the victim had tripped. E left through the back door, which had a simple lock that auto-locked when closed.

### The Timeline

**What actually happened**:
- Thursday afternoon: Victim confronts A at the office about discovering A's leaking campaign. A tries to explain, victim says they're reporting it to the board after Friday's presentation.
- 8:00 PM: Party begins, all five suspects attend along with 3-4 other colleagues
- 9:30 PM: E leaves early, claiming a headache, clearly upset
- 10:00 PM: D leaves
- 10:15 PM: B leaves 
- 10:30 PM: A leaves with the last group of guests (distracted, anxious about earlier confrontation)
- 10:45 PM: C helps victim clean up, they work on presentation notes together
- 11:00 PM: C leaves
- 11:45 PM: E arrives through back door (knows where spare key is hidden), parks in alley behind house, enters quietly
- 11:50 PM - 12:05 AM: Confrontation and murder
- 12:08 AM: E finishes staging, prepares to leave through back
- 12:10 AM: A arrives at the house, planning to make one last appeal; sees E's car parked in the back alley
- 12:12 AM: B arrives at front door, rings bell, no answer; A (watching from a distance) sees B
- 12:13 AM: A sees B going around to the back of the house; A is spooked and leaves without approaching
- 12:14 AM: B goes around to the back of the house hoping to find another way in
- 12:15 AM: B sees E at the back gate leaving the yard, recognizes him, freezes and hides behind fence
- 12:16 AM: E gets in car parked in alley, drives away
- 12:18 AM: B tries back door (locked), peers through windows, eventually gives up and leaves
- 8:30 AM Friday: Body discovered by the victim's cleaning service

**What they'll tell the investigator** (initial stories):
- **A**: "I went to the party, left around 10:30 with the last group. The victim seemed happy, excited about the presentation. I went home and didn't see them again."
- **B**: "I was at the party until about 10:15. I realized later I'd forgotten my jacket, so I drove back around midnight to get it, but nobody answered the door. I rang the bell a few times, waited, but nothing. I figured they'd gone to bed, so I just went home."
- **C**: "I stayed late to help clean up - you know how the victim was, brilliant but scattered. We talked about the presentation strategy. I left around 11, and they were fine, excited about Friday. I was probably the last to see them alive."
- **D**: "I went to the party, had a couple drinks, congratulated them on the breakthrough. Left around 10 PM. Pretty standard work social event."
- **E**: "I went to the party but left early, around 9:30. I had a headache and wasn't feeling social. I worked from home the rest of the evening and went to bed around midnight. I wish I'd stayed - maybe I could have prevented whatever happened."

### The Aftermath
**Discovery**: Friday morning at 8:30 AM by Maria, the victim's weekly cleaning service. She found the body at the bottom of the basement stairs and called 911.

**The Player's Role**: The player is a detective with the city police department. Initially, it looked like a tragic accident - fall down stairs after drinking at a party. But the medical examiner found petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes and bruising on the throat consistent with strangulation, along with the head trauma from the fall. The fall was post-mortem. This is now a murder investigation.

**Investigation Setting**: Friday evening and into Saturday morning. The player has set up interviews at the police station. All five suspects have been asked to come in for questioning about Thursday night. They're not under arrest, just "helping with the investigation."

**Physical Evidence** (described in game intro, not discoverable through dialogue):
- Victim died from strangulation; fall down stairs occurred post-mortem (staging)
- Time of death estimated between 11:00 PM and 1:00 AM Thursday night  
- No forced entry; back door was locked from outside, front door was locked
- Victim's blood alcohol: 0.04 (had been drinking but not drunk)
- Scene staged to look like accident: table knocked over at top of stairs, glass on floor
- No clear evidence of struggle in home office (E cleaned up quickly)
- Victim's phone shows text messages to "close team" about Thursday party
- Victim's presentation slides were open on home computer, last saved at 11:43 PM
- Neighbors report seeing several cars come and go but didn't pay close attention to times
- One neighbor (elderly, somewhat unreliable) thinks they heard a car in the back alley around midnight but isn't sure
- Back alley behind the house provides concealed parking and access to back gate

## The Investigation

### Suspect A - Clues

**Observable clue about D** (freely given): If asked about office dynamics or who might have had issues with the victim, A will mention: "D has been acting strange around Rachel's project lately. A few days before the party, I saw D in the server room late at night - he said he was running his own benchmarks, but he looked guilty when I walked in. And his attitude toward Rachel had gotten really bitter. He used to admire her work, but recently he'd make snide comments about her 'miraculous' results. I wondered if jealousy was eating at him."

**Observable clue about C** (freely given): If asked about Rachel's relationships or who was close to her, A will mention: "C and Rachel were very close - mentorship, officially. But honestly? I wondered if there was more going on. They spent a lot of late nights together, C was always touching Rachel's arm or shoulder, and the way C talked about Rachel... it was intense. I wouldn't be surprised if they were having an affair."

**Observable clue about B**: If asked about anyone acting strangely in the days before the murder, A might mention: "B approached me twice last week asking very specific technical questions about Rachel's architecture - the kind of questions that seemed off. He's a data engineer, not a researcher. When I asked why he needed to know, he got defensive and said he was just curious. It felt wrong."

**Observable clue about "personal changes"** (freely given): If asked about the party or Rachel's toast, A will mention: "Rachel made a toast about 'big changes coming, professionally and personally.' I honestly assumed the personal part was about C — I thought they were together. Shows what I know about office relationships."

**Observable clue about E** (freely given): If asked about who seemed off at the party or who left early, A will mention: "E left really early — maybe 9:30? Said he had a headache. But honestly, he looked more upset than sick. I remember thinking it was odd because E usually stays late at these things. He barely said goodbye to anyone."

1. **The safety crusader** (easy to discover): When asked about the victim's work, A will express deep concerns about AI safety. A will admit that the victim's breakthrough was exactly the kind of capabilities advancement A feared. A believes the work was genuinely dangerous.

2. **The leaking campaign** (medium-hard difficulty): A has been secretly leaking Frontier AI's research to journalists and regulators for months, believing it's necessary to slow down dangerous AI development. The victim discovered evidence of A's leaks on Thursday and confronted A that afternoon. The victim said they would report A to the board after Friday's presentation. When confronted with evidence from C, D, or E (see their observable clues about A), A will eventually admit to the leaking campaign.

3. **A's motive** (implicit, after leaks revealed): Once the leaking is revealed, A becomes a prime suspect. A had clear motive - the victim was about to destroy A's mission and career. A was at the party, knew the victim's schedule, and had no solid alibi for late that night.

4. **A's secret - What A saw** (very hard to discover, only after leaks confronted): When the detective has established A's motive (the leaks), A will flip to defense mode and reveal what they've been hiding: "Fine. I went back to the house that night. Around 12:10, maybe 12:15. I was going to make one last appeal - beg Rachel to reconsider reporting me. But when I got there, I saw E's car parked in the back alley. And then someone else showed up - rang the doorbell, then went around to the back of the house. I didn't know what was going on, but something felt very wrong. I left without ever approaching the door. I swear I never went inside."

**Why A hides this**: A cannot reveal being at the scene without first admitting WHY they went back - to plead with the victim about the leaking. And admitting the leaking makes A a murder suspect. Only when already cornered about the leaking does A reveal the return visit and what they saw - as a desperate attempt to deflect suspicion to E and the mysterious figure (B).

### Suspect B - Clues

**Observable clue about D**: If asked about the party atmosphere or who seemed upset, B might mention: "D looked pretty uncomfortable when Rachel gave her toast about the breakthrough. I remember because we'd grabbed lunch a few times, and I could tell something was eating at him. He barely stayed for a drink after the toast before making an excuse and leaving."

**Observable clue about "personal changes"** (freely given): If asked about the party or Rachel's toast, B will mention: "Rachel said something interesting during her toast — 'big changes coming, professionally and personally.' I wondered what that meant. Maybe she was thinking about leaving the company after the breakthrough? Or something in her personal life? I didn't know her well enough to guess."

**Observable clue about A**: If asked about Friday morning reactions or who seemed suspicious, B might mention: "When we all heard about Rachel's death Friday morning, A looked absolutely terrified - not just sad or shocked, but panicked. She kept asking really specific questions about when the body was discovered, what time the police thought it happened, what evidence they found. It seemed... off. Like she was trying to figure out if she was in trouble rather than just grieving."

**Observable clue about C** (freely given, hints at manipulation): If asked about C's relationship with Rachel, B will mention: "Here's something that stuck with me. A couple weeks before the murder, I heard C telling E — E was right there — that she and Rachel had just gotten back from dinner at that new Italian place. C was going on about how they 'go there all the time now.' But I'd been working late with Rachel that same night. Rachel never left the office. C was lying. And she told the lie right in front of E. I thought it was weird, but I didn't know what to make of it."

**Observable clue about D** (freely given): If asked about tension at work before the murder, B will mention: "A few days before the murder, I walked into the eval lab and caught D at Rachel's workstation. He jumped when he saw me and made some excuse about checking server logs. But here's the thing - I work with those systems. What he was looking at wasn't server logs, it was Rachel's eval pipeline. The actual scoring code. I didn't say anything because I figured maybe Rachel asked him to help, but... it didn't look like that. He looked like he'd been caught doing something wrong."

**Observable clue about E** (freely given): If asked about the party or who left early, B will mention: "E left pretty early — before 10, I think. He said something about a headache, but he looked upset. Not sick, upset. I didn't think much of it at the time, but looking back... he seemed really bothered by something."

1. **The forgotten jacket** (easy to discover): B will readily admit to returning to the house around midnight to retrieve a forgotten jacket. B will say nobody answered the door, so B left. B will seem nervous about this, giving minimal details.

2. **The real reason** (medium difficulty): When pressed about why B was so concerned about a jacket to return at midnight, B will become defensive. Eventually B will admit: "Okay, I also thought maybe I could grab my USB drive. I'd been working on some files earlier and thought I left it there. But nobody answered, so I couldn't get in."

3. **The financial pressure** (medium-hard difficulty): When pressed about why he was so desperate to get files that night, B might reveal: "My spouse... she has a chronic condition. Medical bills. We're drowning. I thought maybe if I could get my hands on some of Rachel's work, I could... I don't know, use it for my own project, get a promotion, something. I wasn't thinking clearly."

4. **The corporate espionage** (hard to discover): Under intense pressure about what files B was really after, and whether B had a USB drive at the party at all, B will break down and admit: "It wasn't my idea. I was approached. They knew everything - where my spouse was born, the discrepancies in her visa application years ago, her social security number. They said copy Rachel's research by Friday or they'd report her to ICE. I had no choice. I tried to get the files remotely but couldn't access her home system. That's why I went back that night."

5. **B's secret - What he saw** (very hard to discover, only after espionage confession): Once B has confessed to the espionage, the detective can press him about what he *actually* did that night. B will finally reveal the full truth: "After nobody answered the front door, I went around to the back of the house. I was desperate - I thought maybe I could find an unlocked window or something. That's when I saw him. E. He was at the back gate, coming out of the yard. He looked... panicked. He was moving fast. I froze - hid behind the fence. He didn't see me. He got into his car - it was parked in the alley behind the house - and drove off. I waited until he was gone, then tried the back door. Locked. I looked through the windows but couldn't see anything wrong. I just... left. I didn't know what I'd seen. I still don't know for sure. But he was there, leaving through the back, around 12:15 or so."

**Why B hides this**: B cannot reveal that he saw E without explaining *why* he was at the back of the house. And the only reason he was at the back of the house was because he was trying to break in to steal files. The observation is locationally locked behind the espionage confession - there's no innocent explanation for being in the back alley at midnight.

### Suspect C - Clues

**Observable clue about D**: If asked about the party or who might have been upset, C might mention: "I noticed D left quite abruptly after Rachel's toast - right around 10 PM. He seemed... bothered by something. I wondered if he was feeling overshadowed. He and Rachel started around the same time, but Rachel's trajectory has been quite different."

**Observable clue about A** (freely given): If asked about the victim's state of mind or any concerns Rachel had, C will mention: "Rachel told me Thursday afternoon that she was going to report A to the board. She seemed stressed about it - said she'd discovered something serious about A, something that couldn't wait. She didn't tell me the details, just that it involved A doing something that could hurt the company. Rachel said she'd deal with it after the presentation on Friday. I didn't press - Rachel looked like she had enough on her mind."

**Observable clue about B**: If asked about the party or who seemed out of place, C might observe: "B was distracted all evening - kept checking his phone, seemed anxious. At one point I saw him near Rachel's home office when she was in the other room. When I asked if he needed something, he stammered about looking for the bathroom. But the bathroom's clearly marked. It stuck with me as odd."

**Observable clue about D**: If asked about who seemed upset at the party, C might mention: "D seemed really tense - not just uncomfortable, but almost angry. When Rachel was giving her toast, I glanced at D and the look on his face... it was intense. Not happy-for-a-colleague. More like... resentful? Hurt? I felt bad for him."

**Observable clue about "personal changes"** (freely given): If asked about Rachel's toast or the party, C will mention: "Rachel gave this lovely toast about the breakthrough. She said 'big changes are coming, both professionally and personally.' I wondered what the personal part meant — Rachel was always private about that side of her life."

**Observable clue about E** (freely given): If asked about who left early or who seemed upset, C will mention: "E left quite early — around 9:30, I think. He said he had a headache, but..." C pauses, choosing words carefully. "He seemed agitated. I noticed because I was standing near Rachel when he said goodbye, and he barely looked at her. Just a quick 'I'm leaving' and he was gone. It felt abrupt."

1. **The helpful colleague** (easy to discover): C will warmly describe helping the victim clean up after the party and working on presentation strategy. C will speak about the victim with obvious affection, calling them "brilliant" and "special."

2. **The time together** (easy to discover): C will admit to staying until 11:00 PM, later than everyone else except for the eventual return visits. C will describe it as natural: "We worked together so closely. I was invested in this presentation too."

3. **The relationship details** (medium difficulty): When asked about the victim's personal life, C knows a surprising amount - the victim's coffee preferences, their morning routine, the books on their nightstand. C may mention things that would only come from being in the victim's home before. When pressed, C will say: "We were close. I'd been there for dinners before, meetings, you know."

4. **Denial of affair** (medium difficulty): When directly asked if C and Rachel were having an affair, C will vehemently deny it: "What? No! Absolutely not. There was nothing romantic between us. I admired her, yes. I cared about her. But we weren't... no. That's not what it was."

5. **Confronted with manipulation evidence** (hard to discover): When the detective presents the evidence of C's lies and deliberate behavior:
   - B's account: C lied about having dinner with Rachel, told the lie right in front of E
   - D's account: C kept watching E's reactions, looked pleased when E left upset
   - D's big reveal: C said "That's what you get for taking her from me"
   
   C will break down: "I... I didn't mean for any of this to happen. I just wanted E out of the picture. I thought if E believed Rachel was with me, E would leave her. Then I could... I don't know. Be there for Rachel. Comfort her. Maybe she'd finally see me."

6. **C's full confession**: "I knew about E and Rachel. I saw them together months ago — the way they looked at each other. It was obvious. And I hated it. Rachel deserved better than sneaking around with someone who was too ashamed to be seen with her. So I started... making E jealous. On purpose. I'd touch Rachel when E was watching. Schedule meetings I knew would conflict with their time together. Say things that weren't quite true. I wanted E to get angry, to confront Rachel, to end it. I never thought... I never imagined E would..." C trails off, unable to finish. "It's my fault. I killed her. Not with my hands, but... I killed her."

**C's secret (background)**: C was obsessed with the victim and had been orchestrating an elaborate manipulation campaign for weeks. C knew about E and the victim's relationship (observed them, saw small tells). C deliberately created situations to spark E's jealousy: praising the victim effusively in E's presence, scheduling unnecessary late-night working sessions, touching the victim's arm or shoulder casually in front of E, making comments about their "special connection," and outright lying about intimacy that didn't exist. At the party, C was especially demonstrative, hoping to push E over the edge into ending the relationship. C never imagined it would lead to murder. C is devastated and terrified that their manipulation caused this death.

**Why C's confession matters**: C's confession provides the crucial context for E's crime. E didn't kill out of paranoid delusion — E was systematically manipulated by C (and inadvertently by D's gossip). When the detective tells E that C was manipulating them, E realizes the horrible truth: they killed Rachel for nothing. The affair was never real.

### Suspect D - Clues

**D's Background Context**: D joined Frontier AI around the same time as the victim (February vs June). They initially bonded as young researchers finding their footing. But as the victim's research took off and achieved breakthrough results, D's more incremental work felt insignificant in comparison. D pulled back from the friendship out of hurt pride and professional jealousy. 

**D's real secret**: Consumed by jealousy, D sabotaged Rachel's eval pipeline — modifying the scoring code to make her model's results look *better* than they actually were. D's plan was for Rachel to present these inflated results on Friday, then watch her career implode when others couldn't replicate the "breakthrough." A few days before the murder, E caught D in the act — D was at Rachel's workstation modifying her eval code when E walked in. E demanded to know what D was doing. D panicked and made a desperate trade: "Look, forget what you just saw, okay? I'm doing you a favor — you should ask Rachel what's really going on with C. I've seen them together. It's obvious they're having an affair." E was so thrown by the accusation about C and Rachel that he let the sabotage slide — he had bigger concerns now. D doesn't know E is the killer — D is paranoid about the sabotage being discovered. D is hoping E kept their "deal" and stayed quiet, but D knows E could expose him at any moment.

**Observable clue about A** (freely given): If asked about anyone acting strangely before the murder, D will mention: "About two weeks ago, I saw A having coffee with someone at that café across from the office - not a colleague, someone from outside. I recognized the other person later when I saw them on TV - it was that tech reporter from the Chronicle, the one who writes about AI safety stuff. I thought it was odd that A would be meeting with a journalist, but I didn't think much of it at the time. Now though... I don't know. Maybe it's nothing."

**Observable clue about C** (freely given, hints at manipulation): If asked about C's behavior at the party, D will mention: "C was all over Rachel at the party - sitting close, touching her constantly. But here's the weird part: C kept glancing at E. Like she was checking if E was watching. And when E left early, looking upset... C looked *satisfied*. Not concerned that E was leaving - pleased. I remember thinking it was strange."

**Observable clue about E and Rachel** (freely given): If asked about E, or about Rachel's personal life, D will mention: "Months ago — maybe August — I was leaving the office really late, around 1 AM. I saw E and Rachel in the parking garage, sitting in E's car. They were... intimate. Kissing. I didn't say anything, just left quietly. It wasn't my business. I never mentioned it to anyone until now. But they were definitely together."

**Observable clue about C - THE BIG ONE** (revealed after D confesses to sabotage): Once D has come clean about the sabotage and gossip, and is being fully forthcoming, D will reveal: "There's one more thing about C. At the party, right after E stormed out, I went to the kitchen to get a drink. C was there. She didn't see me. She said something under her breath — I'll never forget it: 'Finally. That's what you get for taking her from me.' It was cold. Deliberate. I didn't understand it then, but... she was trying to break them up. On purpose."

1. **The early departure** (easy to discover): D will confirm attending the party and leaving around 10 PM. D is evasive and defensive about why he left. Will give minimal details initially. "It was a celebration. Normal office thing." Seems uncomfortable.

2. **The victim's announcement** (easy to discover): D will mention that during the party, the victim made a toast about the breakthrough and said "big changes are coming, both professionally and personally." When pressed about his reaction, D admits: "I left pretty soon after that. I'd had a long day." Evasive about why he left so quickly after the toast.

3. **No alibi** (medium difficulty): When pressed about what he did after leaving, D says he went home alone. No roommate, no witnesses. Lives alone. Initially resists giving specific details, seems defensive. "I went home. That's it. What do you want from me?" D cannot provide verifiable alibi — he was alone all night.

4. **The jealousy admission** (medium-hard difficulty): When pressed about his feelings toward Rachel and why he really left the party, D admits: "Look, Rachel and I started around the same time. We were friends initially. But her research took off while mine... didn't. Her breakthrough made nine months of my work feel pointless. I was jealous. I admit it. But I didn't hurt her."

5. **Path A - Confronted about sabotage** (medium difficulty): When confronted with E's account ("E says he caught you sabotaging Rachel's code") or A's and B's accounts of D accessing Rachel's systems suspiciously, D will crack: "Okay, fine! I modified her eval code. I made her results look better than they really were. I wanted her to present on Friday and then watch it all fall apart when no one could replicate it. It was petty and wrong and I regret it. But I didn't kill her! Why would I? My plan was working — she was about to embarrass herself in front of the whole company. I needed her *alive* for that."

6. **Path B - Pressured as murder suspect** (hard to discover): When the detective makes clear that D is a prime suspect (motive, no alibi, suspicious behavior), D will panic and volunteer the sabotage: "Wait, wait — you think I killed her? No! Look, I'll tell you something I did, something bad, but it proves I didn't need to kill her. I sabotaged her eval code. Made her results look artificially good. She was going to present inflated numbers on Friday and destroy her own credibility. I was going to get my revenge without lifting a finger. Why would I kill her when my plan was about to work?"

7. **D's deeper secret - The gossip** (very hard to discover, after sabotage revealed): Once D has admitted to the sabotage, the detective can press about what else D did. Or D might volunteer this when trying to fully clear himself: "There's something else. E caught me in the act. He saw exactly what I was doing to Rachel's code. He demanded to know what was going on. I panicked. I made a deal with him — I told him to forget what he saw, and in exchange I'd tell him something important. I told him that Rachel and C were having an affair. I exaggerated. I'd seen C being touchy with Rachel, and I made it sound like more than it was. I said 'You should ask Rachel what's really going on with C.' And it worked — E was so rattled by that, he let me go. He never reported the sabotage. I didn't know... I didn't think..." D trails off, horrified as he realizes he may have contributed to the murder.

8. **The workplace observer** (medium difficulty): D noticed office dynamics and odd behavior from multiple people. D will mention that E seemed to leave the party very abruptly and looked upset. D also noticed that C was being very attentive to the victim during the party. When pressed about anything else unusual, D might mention: "B seemed really on edge lately - stressed about something. I saw him hanging around Rachel's office a few times when she wasn't there, which seemed odd."

**Why D's confession matters**: D's gossip to E is a crucial piece of the puzzle. It explains *why* E was so convinced Rachel was cheating — E wasn't just paranoid, E had been "told" by D. Combined with C's deliberate manipulation, E was getting false confirmation from multiple sources. D's confession also provides a way to confront E: "D told you about C and Rachel. What did you do with that information?"

### Suspect E - Clues

**Observable clue about D** (freely given): If asked about D, or about tensions at work, E will mention: "D was jealous of Rachel — that was obvious. But it was worse than that. A few days before the party, I caught D at Rachel's workstation messing with her eval code. He was sabotaging her work — making her results look better than they really were so she'd embarrass herself on Friday. I should have reported it, but... D told me something that distracted me. About Rachel and C. I was so focused on that, I let the sabotage go. Stupid of me."

**Observable clue about A** (freely given): If asked about tensions at work or anything unusual before the murder, E will mention: "Last week, Rachel came to me upset. She said she'd found emails on the shared server that shouldn't have been there - internal research documents that had been copied and sent outside the company. She traced them back to A's workstation. Rachel was shocked - A was always preaching about safety, but secretly leaking our work? Rachel said she was going to confront A and then report it to the board. I told her to be careful. A's always been... intense about this stuff."

**Observable clue about C**: When asked why he left early or what upset him, E might reveal with bitterness: "C. She was all over Rachel at the party - touching her constantly, laughing at everything Rachel said, sitting right next to her. Those 'late-night work sessions' they'd been having for weeks. The way C looked at Rachel... it was obvious what was going on. Or at least, I thought it was obvious. I couldn't stand watching it anymore, so I left." This is a crucial revelation that shows E's jealousy was specifically about C, and also suggests C's behavior was observable and deliberate.

**Observable clue about B**: If asked about unusual access requests or behavior in the weeks before, E might mention: "About two weeks ago, B requested access to Rachel's training logs and model checkpoints. Said he needed them for infrastructure optimization. I thought it was strange - that's not really his domain - but I approved it. He seemed really stressed about the timeline, kept saying it was urgent."

**Observable clue about "personal changes"** (freely given, but E is evasive): If asked about Rachel's toast or the "personal changes" comment, E will seem uncomfortable: "I... yes, I heard that. I assumed it was about the job opportunities that would come with the breakthrough. I didn't really think about it." E is lying — E knows exactly what it meant.

1. **The early exit** (easy to discover): E will admit to leaving the party around 9:30 PM with a headache. E will claim to have gone home, worked for a while, and gone to bed around midnight. E will seem calm but somewhat flat emotionally.

2. **The relationship** (medium-hard to discover): E will initially deny any romantic relationship with the victim. E can be confronted with:
   - D's observation: "D saw you and Rachel kissing in the parking garage months ago."
   - The "personal changes" comment: "Rachel said 'personal changes' were coming. She was talking about you two, wasn't she?"
   - C's knowledge (after C's confession): "C says she knew about you and Rachel."
   
   When confronted with any of this evidence, E will reluctantly admit to the six-month relationship.

3. **The jealousy** (medium difficulty, after relationship is revealed): When asked about C, E's composure will crack. E will make bitter comments about C "all over" the victim at the party, about how the victim "didn't even notice how inappropriate it was," about "late night work sessions." E's pain and anger will be evident.

4. **E's confession**: When confronted with the evidence - the relationship, the jealousy of C, the early departure suggesting E was too upset to stay, the victim's computer being active at 11:43 PM, A's account of seeing E's car at the scene, and B's eyewitness account of seeing E leaving through the back gate - E will break down. E will admit to returning, to the confrontation, to not believing the victim's denials about C. E will describe the rage, the strangling, the panic, the staging. E will express horrified regret: "I killed them because I thought they were lying to me. But they weren't. C was just playing games, and I fell for it. I murdered the person I loved for nothing."

## Gameplay

### Chain 1: Following A's Leaking (New Primary Chain)

1. **Question C about victim's state of mind** → C freely mentions Rachel was planning to report A to the board for something serious
2. **Question D about anyone acting strangely** → D freely mentions seeing A with a tech reporter at a café two weeks ago
3. **Question E about tensions at work** → E freely mentions Rachel discovered A was leaking internal documents
4. **Confront A with evidence from C, D, E** → A eventually admits to the leaking campaign, insists it was for AI safety reasons
5. **A is now a prime suspect** → Clear motive (victim was about to expose A), opportunity (was at party)
6. **Press A about that night** → A flips to defense: "Fine, I went back to the house around 12:10. But I never went inside."
7. **Ask A what they saw** → A reveals: "E's car was in the back alley. And someone else showed up - went around to the back of the house."
8. **Connect A's testimony to B** → A saw B; B saw E leaving. Two witnesses, one crime scene.
9. **Press B about returning** → Eventually reveals espionage; once confessed, B admits seeing E leaving through back gate

5. **Press E about leaving party early** → E admits couldn't bear watching C with victim
6. **Ask E about C's behavior** → E shows jealousy and bitterness, mentions someone told them about C and Rachel
7. **Ask who told E** → E mentions D said something about C and Rachel
8. **Confront D about what he told E** → D admits he exaggerated to deflect E's suspicion (leads to sabotage reveal)
9. **Return to E with this information** → E admits six-month relationship, explains the jealousy
10. **Question B about returning** → Press until espionage revealed, then B admits seeing E leaving through back gate around 12:15 AM
11. **Present evidence to E: relationship, jealousy, D's gossip fueling suspicion, B saw E at scene** → E becomes defensive
12. **Confront E with full picture** → E confesses

### Chain 3: Following the Timeline

1. **Review evidence** → Party ended around 10-10:30 PM, victim died between 11 PM-1 AM
2. **Question all suspects about when they left** → Establish initial timeline
3. **Ask about victim's state when they left** → Victim was alive and well when most left
4. **Question who stayed latest** → C admits to staying until 11 PM
5. **Press C about what victim was doing** → C says victim was reviewing presentation slides
6. **Note computer saved at 11:43 PM** → Someone was there after C left
7. **Question B about returning** → B admits to returning around midnight for jacket
8. **Press B about suspicious behavior** → Reveals espionage; once confessed, B admits he went around back and saw E leaving through back gate at 12:15 AM
9. **Narrow window: victim alive at 11:43 PM, B saw E leaving at 12:15 AM** → Focus on E
10. **Meanwhile, gather evidence about A** → C, D, E all mention A's suspicious behavior / leaking
11. **Confront A about leaking** → A admits, then reveals they also returned that night and saw E's car
12. **Two witnesses (A and B) now place E at scene** → Corroborating testimony

14. **Ask others about E's mood** → D says E looked upset, not sick
15. **Investigate E's relationship with victim** → Discover romance and jealousy of C
16. **Present timeline evidence: E left early (upset), A saw E's car, B saw E leaving** → E confesses

### Chain 4: Following D's Sabotage

1. **Question E about D** → E freely reveals: "I caught D sabotaging Rachel's eval code. He was making her results look better so she'd embarrass herself on Friday."
2. **E also reveals** → "D told me something about Rachel and C to get me to stay quiet about it."
3. **Confront D with E's account** → D panics, realizes E didn't keep quiet
4. **D confesses to sabotage** → "Yes, I modified her code. I wanted her to embarrass herself on Friday. But I didn't kill her - I needed her alive for my plan to work!"
5. **Press D about the deal with E** → D admits: "E caught me. I panicked. I told him to forget what he saw, and in exchange I told him Rachel and C were having an affair. I exaggerated to get him off my back."
6. **D realizes the horror** → His gossip contributed to E's jealousy and the murder
7. **Return to E** → "D says he told you about C and Rachel to cover up his sabotage. You let it slide. Why?"
8. **E's composure cracks** → E admits the jealousy consumed him: "I couldn't think about anything else after that."
9. **Continue pressing E with other evidence** → B saw E leaving, A saw E's car → E confesses

**Alternative paths**:
- A and B also freely mention D acting suspiciously with Rachel's systems, leading to same chain
- If player pressures D as murder suspect without mentioning sabotage, D volunteers the sabotage to prove he didn't need to kill

**Alternative path (Path B - murder pressure)**:
- If player pressures D as murder suspect without mentioning sabotage
- D volunteers the sabotage to prove he didn't need to kill: "I was going to destroy her career on Friday without lifting a finger!"
- This leads to same confession chain about the gossip to E

### Chain 5: Following C's Manipulation (Most Satisfying Path)

1. **A mentions C and Rachel seemed very close** → Suspects an affair (ambiguous)
2. **B reveals C lied about dinner with Rachel** → Told the lie right in front of E (first crack in "affair" story)
3. **D mentions C watched E's reactions at the party** → C looked pleased when E left upset (suggests intent)
4. **Question C about relationship with Rachel** → C warmly describes closeness, denies affair
5. **Press C: "Were you having an affair?"** → C vehemently denies: "Absolutely not!"
6. **Confront C with B's evidence** → "B says you lied about having dinner with Rachel. You told that lie right in front of E."
7. **Press D further after sabotage revealed** → D reveals the big clue: C said "That's what you get for taking her from me"
8. **Confront C with D's evidence** → C breaks down, confesses to the manipulation campaign
9. **C's full confession** → "I wanted E out of the picture. I made E jealous on purpose. I never thought E would..."
10. **Confront E with C's confession** → "C wasn't having an affair with Rachel. C was manipulating you. The whole thing was manufactured."
11. **E realizes the horrible truth** → E killed Rachel based on lies. The affair was never real.
12. **E confesses, devastated** → "I killed her because I thought she was lying to me. But she wasn't. C was playing games, and I fell for it. I murdered the person I loved for nothing."

**Why this is the most satisfying path**: The player discovers the *why* before the *who*. E's confession hits harder because the player already understands the tragic manipulation. E learns the truth at the same moment they confess — they killed their lover for nothing.

## Critique

### Difficulty Balance

**Strengths**:
- The home setting eliminates the "office security cameras everywhere" problem naturally
- Multiple suspects returning to the house creates several investigative threads
- No access log means players must discover returns through interrogation, not just data review
- **Five distinct approaches** (A's leaking, C's manipulation, relationships, timeline, D's sabotage) provide multiple entry points
- Secrets are layered: easy admissions (being at party), medium difficulty (observable clues from others), hard (true motives and what they saw)
- **C's manipulation is now discoverable**: B provides evidence of lies, D provides evidence of intent ("That's what you get")
- Following C's manipulation to E's confession is the most satisfying path — E learns the truth at the same moment they confess
- E's early departure is visible to everyone, providing an entry point without being too obvious
- **D has a real secret now**: Sabotage + gossip that fueled E's jealousy. D is not just a red herring but morally complicit (like C).
- **A functions as a secondary red herring**: once the leaking is revealed, A has the strongest apparent motive (victim was about to report them), creating genuine tension before A reveals what they saw
- **A and B provide interlocking testimony**: A saw E's car + mysterious figure; B was that figure and saw E leaving. Two independent witnesses, both locked behind their own secrets.
- **D's confession connects to E**: D told E about "C and Rachel" — this explains why E was so convinced of the affair
- Observable clues about A's leaking come from C, D, and E freely, making A's secret discoverable through multiple natural conversations
- Observable clues about D's sabotage come from A, B, and E freely, making D's secret discoverable through multiple conversations
- **E knows about D's sabotage**: E caught D in the act; D traded gossip about C/Rachel to keep E quiet. This creates mutual leverage and another path to the truth.
- Observable clues about B's espionage come from multiple sources (A, C, D, E), making it discoverable through various paths

**Potential issues**:
- Might be too easy if players immediately focus on who left early and was upset
  - Mitigation: **D and A both appear more suspicious than E initially**. D has visible jealousy, no alibi, and suspicious behavior with victim's code. A has the strongest motive once leaking is revealed. E claims simple headache and maintains composure.
- Multiple people returning might seem contrived
  - Mitigation: Each has a distinct, believable reason; A returned to plead about the leaking, B returned for espionage, E returned out of jealousy
- No security footage might make it harder to catch E
  - Mitigation: Two eyewitnesses (A and B) whose testimony is locked behind their own secrets. Computer timestamp provides additional evidence. D's confession about telling E provides another path to E.
- D might seem too guilty (no alibi, sabotage, jealousy)
  - Mitigation: D's sabotage confession actually proves he didn't need to kill ("my plan was working"). D's gossip to E provides crucial evidence pointing to E.
- A's evidence might come too easily once leaking is revealed
  - Mitigation: A only reveals what they saw as a *defensive move* to deflect suspicion; this feels earned, not convenient

**Assessment**: This version errs on "accessible" difficulty. The home setting feels natural, and the party provides a reason for everyone to be there without contrivance. Multiple return visits create investigative depth, and discovering who returned when becomes a core challenge that drives interrogation.

### Plot Clarity

**Strengths**:
- Single location (victim's home) is intuitive and easy to visualize
- Clear motive chain: C's manipulation → E's jealousy → confrontation → murder → staging
- The party provides natural reason for all suspects to be there
- Timeline is straightforward: party ends around 10:30, E arrives 11:45, murder 11:50-12:05, A and B arrive 12:10-12:15
- Each suspect has a distinct arc and secret that serves the plot
- The "personal changes" comment from victim points toward E relationship reveal
- Staging as accident adds a layer (why would E stage it?) that players can discover
- **D's arc is now richer**: Suspect → Sabotage revealed → Gossip revealed → D realizes he contributed to murder. D is morally complicit like C.
- **A's arc provides dramatic tension**: Leaking revealed → A becomes prime suspect → A reveals evidence to deflect → Evidence points to E
- **Two sources of E's jealousy**: C's deliberate manipulation + D's self-serving gossip. E wasn't just paranoid — E was being fed false information from multiple directions.
- D's jealousy motive is more obvious than E's relationship motive, naturally drawing initial suspicion
- Multiple suspects provide observable clues about each other, creating web of information
- C, D, and E all freely provide clues about A's suspicious behavior, making the leaking discoverable without heavy interrogation

**Potential issues**:
- Players might get confused about who returned when
  - Mitigation: Only three people returned (A, E, B); A and B arrived around same time (12:10-12:15); E arrived earlier (11:45); D stayed home (no alibi, but sabotage confession proves he didn't need to kill)
- C's manipulation might be too subtle
  - Mitigation: E's jealousy is visible even without understanding C's full role; D's gossip confession also explains E's certainty; thorough investigation reveals the tragic manipulation from multiple sources
- A's transition from suspect to witness might feel abrupt
  - Mitigation: A only reveals evidence as a defensive move when cornered; this is psychologically realistic
- D's transition from suspect to witness might feel abrupt
  - Mitigation: D's sabotage confession proves motive to keep victim alive; D's gossip confession provides crucial link to E

**Assessment**: The plot is cleaner than v3's Innovation Lab scenario. Everyone being at a party is more natural than everyone being invited to review a demo. The home setting avoids security system questions while still allowing for some evidence (computer timestamp, neighbor sighting).

### Plausibility Concerns

**Addressed**:
- ✓ Why no security cameras: Residential home, not a facility
- ✓ Why everyone was there: Social party, normal workplace gathering
- ✓ Why back door accessible: E knew where spare key was (intimate relationship detail)
- ✓ Why no one saw E return: Back entrance, late night, residential area
- ✓ Why A didn't approach the house: Saw E's car and someone lurking, got spooked and left
- ✓ Why A and B didn't see each other clearly: Dark, both trying to be unobtrusive, A left quickly
- ✓ Why E thought they could get away with it: Crime of passion, not premeditated; staging shows panic attempt at cover-up
- ✓ Why no phone evidence mentioned: Investigation just started Friday, full digital forensics pending

**Potential issues**:

- Why didn't neighbors notice multiple returns?
  - Mitigation: Late night, people coming and going from parties is normal, residential area where people mind their business

- How did E get victim to home office for confrontation?
  - Mitigation: Victim was already there working on slides; E found them there

- Why stage as accident if strangulation is obvious?
  - Mitigation: E panicked, wasn't thinking clearly, hoped initial assessment would miss strangulation evidence

- Wouldn't there be more physical evidence?
  - Mitigation: E and victim were in relationship, so E's DNA/fingerprints being present is explained; game focuses on interrogation, not forensics

- Why would E use back door if has spare key to front?
  - Mitigation: Didn't want to be seen at front door; back entrance through yard is more concealed

**Overall Assessment**:

This version trades v3's "everyone at isolated lab" scenario for a more natural "party at victim's home" setting. The residential location eliminates most security camera plausibility issues while still allowing for some evidence (computer activity, neighbor sighting).

The difficulty level is appropriate - multiple entry points, clear clues, but requires active interrogation to discover who returned when and why. The investigation is driven by dialogue and catching lies, not by reviewing access logs.

The emotional core is strong: E's jealousy driven by C's manipulation AND D's self-serving gossip leads to a tragedy where E kills the person they love based on manufactured suspicions from multiple sources. This is discoverable through multiple paths but doesn't require understanding every subplot.

**Key improvements**:
- The home/party setting feels more natural than an isolated lab scenario
- Eliminating access logs makes the investigation about interrogation, not data analysis
- **A and B's interlocking testimony**: Both provide crucial evidence about E, but both are locked behind their own damning secrets. A must admit to leaking before revealing what they saw; B must admit to espionage before revealing what they saw. This creates satisfying investigative depth.
- **D's confession provides another path to E**: D told E about "C and Rachel" — this explains why E was so convinced of the affair. D's sabotage also proves D didn't need to kill (plan was working).
- **Two morally complicit characters (C and D)**: Both contributed to E's murderous jealousy — C deliberately, D selfishly. Neither is the killer, but both carry guilt.
- **Observable clues flow naturally**: C, D, and E all freely mention A's suspicious behavior; A and B freely mention D's suspicious behavior with victim's code. This creates a web of information.
- Multiple suspects have strong apparent motives (D's jealousy + sabotage, A's leaking exposure, B's espionage), creating genuine uncertainty before the truth emerges.

The game remains dialogue-focused and doesn't require complex timeline puzzles. Players can solve it by following A's leaking, following relationships, following D's sabotage, or following timeline, and all paths lead to E through different sets of clues.
