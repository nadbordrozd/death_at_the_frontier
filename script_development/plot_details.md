# Death at the Frontier - Plot Details v4

## The Night of the Crime

### The Setting
**When**: Thursday night into early Friday morning, between 11:00 PM and 1:00 AM
**Where**: The victim's home - a small house in a residential neighborhood, 15 minutes from the Frontier AI campus

**The Circumstances**:
The victim was hosting an informal evening at home. Earlier that week, the victim had announced to close colleagues that they had achieved a major breakthrough in their research and wanted to celebrate with the team before presenting it to leadership on Friday afternoon. The victim invited the core research team and key stakeholders over for drinks and conversation on Thursday evening, starting at 8 PM.

This was typical of the victim - charismatic, eager to share success, and comfortable blurring professional and social boundaries. By 10:30 PM, most guests had left, but a few remained or returned later for various reasons.

**Why the characters were there**:
- **Victim**: Hosting the celebration, excited about the breakthrough and upcoming presentation
- **Suspect A**: Attended the party, left with most guests around 10:30 PM, but returned around 11:15 PM to have a private conversation about safety concerns
- **Suspect B**: Attended the party, left around 10:15 PM, returned around 12:15 AM claiming to have forgotten their jacket, but actually hoping to access the victim's home computer
- **Suspect C**: Attended the party, was the last "official" guest, left around 11:00 PM after helping the victim clean up
- **Suspect D**: Attended the party, left around 10:00 PM and went home
- **Suspect E**: Attended the party briefly but left early around 9:30 PM, claiming a headache, but actually unable to bear watching C and the victim together; returned around 11:45 PM

### The Deed
**Method**: Strangulation followed by staging to look like a fall

**How it happened**: 
E returned at 11:45 PM and found the victim alone in the home office, reviewing slides for Friday's presentation. E had been consumed by jealousy all evening - watching C and the victim laughing together, C's hand on the victim's shoulder, the intimate way C spoke about "our breakthrough." E came back to confront the victim, to demand the truth about C.

The victim was genuinely confused by E's accusations. There was nothing with C - just a good working relationship. But E had been poisoned by weeks of C's manipulation and couldn't believe it. The argument escalated. E grabbed the victim by the throat, initially just to make them listen, to stop the denials. But rage took over. E strangled the victim until they stopped moving.

In panic, E dragged the victim's body to the top of the basement stairs and pushed it down, then knocked over a small table to make it look like the victim had tripped. E left through the back door, which had a simple lock that auto-locked when closed.

### The Timeline

**What actually happened**:
- 8:00 PM: Party begins, all five suspects attend along with 3-4 other colleagues
- 9:30 PM: E leaves early, claiming a headache, clearly upset
- 10:00 PM: D leaves
- 10:15 PM: B leaves 
- 10:30 PM: A leaves with the last group of guests
- 10:45 PM: C helps victim clean up, they work on presentation notes together
- 11:00 PM: C leaves
- 11:15 PM: A returns through front door (victim lets them in)
- 11:20 PM - 11:40 PM: A and victim have tense discussion about safety concerns
- 11:40 PM: A leaves through front door
- 11:45 PM: E arrives through back door (knows where spare key is hidden), enters quietly
- 11:50 PM - 12:05 AM: Confrontation and murder
- 12:10 AM: E leaves through back door
- 12:15 AM: B arrives at front door, rings bell, no answer, peers through windows, sees nothing suspicious, tries door (locked), eventually leaves
- 8:30 AM Friday: Body discovered by the victim's cleaning service

**What they'll tell the investigator** (initial stories):
- **A**: "I went to the party, left around 10:30 with the last group. The victim seemed happy, excited about the presentation. I went home and didn't see them again."
- **B**: "I was at the party until about 10:15. I realized later I'd forgotten my jacket, so I drove back around midnight to get it, but nobody answered the door. I figured they'd gone to bed, so I just went home. I'll get the jacket later, I thought."
- **C**: "I stayed late to help clean up - you know how the victim was, brilliant but scattered. We talked about the presentation strategy. I left around 11, and they were fine, excited about Friday. I was probably the last to see them alive."
- **D**: "I went to the party, had a couple drinks, congratulated them on the breakthrough. Left around 10 PM. Pretty standard work social event."
- **E**: "I went to the party but left early, around 9:30. I had a headache and wasn't feeling social. I worked from home the rest of the evening and went to bed around midnight. I wish I'd stayed - maybe I could have prevented whatever happened."

### The Aftermath
**Discovery**: Friday morning at 8:30 AM by Maria, the victim's weekly cleaning service. She found the body at the bottom of the basement stairs and called 911.

**The Player's Role**: The player is a detective with the city police department. Initially, it looked like a tragic accident - fall down stairs after drinking at a party. But the medical examiner found petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes and bruising on the throat consistent with strangulation, along with the head trauma from the fall. The fall was post-mortem. This is now a murder investigation.

**Investigation Setting**: Friday evening and into Saturday morning. The player has set up interviews at the police station. All five suspects have been asked to come in for questioning about Thursday night. They're not under arrest, just "helping with the investigation."

**Physical Evidence** (described in game intro, not discoverable through dialogue):
- Victim died from strangulation; fall down stairs occurred post-mortem (staging)
- Time of death estimated between 11:00 PM and 1:00 AM Thursday night  
- No forced entry; back door was locked from outside, front door was locked
- Victim's blood alcohol: 0.04 (had been drinking but not drunk)
- Scene staged to look like accident: table knocked over at top of stairs, glass on floor
- No clear evidence of struggle in home office (E cleaned up quickly)
- Victim's phone shows text messages to "close team" about Thursday party
- Victim's presentation slides were open on home computer, last saved at 11:43 PM
- Neighbors report seeing several cars come and go but didn't pay close attention to times
- One neighbor (elderly, somewhat unreliable) thinks they saw someone leaving through the back yard around midnight but isn't sure
- **D's alibi evidence** (verifiable upon investigation): DoorDash delivery to D's home address timestamped 11:15 PM, D's Valorant match history shows continuous online gameplay 11:28 PM-1:03 AM, D's apartment building manager has noise complaint record for D's unit at 12:07 AM (loud yelling/banging)

## The Investigation

### Suspect A - Clues

**Observable clue about D**: If asked about office dynamics or who might have had issues with the victim, A might mention: "D seemed to distance himself from Rachel in recent months. I noticed some tension there - professional, I think. D is working on optimization while Rachel achieved a paradigm-shifting breakthrough. That kind of comparison can be difficult."

**Observable clue about C**: If asked about Rachel's relationships or who was close to her, A might mention: "C was very close to Rachel - mentorship, officially. But I noticed they spent a lot of late nights together working, more than seemed strictly necessary. I wondered sometimes if C's interest in Rachel went beyond professional mentorship. The way she talked about Rachel... there was something intense there."

**Observable clue about B**: If asked about anyone acting strangely in the days before the murder, A might mention: "B approached me twice last week asking very specific technical questions about Rachel's architecture - the kind of questions that seemed off. He's a data engineer, not a researcher. When I asked why he needed to know, he got defensive and said he was just curious. It felt wrong."

**Observable clue about D**: If asked about who else was around that night, A might mention: "I saw D's car in the parking lot when I returned to the office around 10:45 PM Thursday night to grab some files. I thought it was odd - I assumed everyone had gone home after the party. But maybe he went back to work? Some people deal with stress that way."

1. **The safety crusader** (easy to discover): When asked about the victim's work, A will express deep concerns about AI safety. A will admit that the victim's breakthrough was exactly the kind of capabilities advancement A feared. A believes the work was genuinely dangerous.

2. **The secret return** (hard to discover): A initially claims to have left at 10:30 and gone home. Under sustained pressure about how strongly A felt about stopping the presentation, A will eventually admit to returning around 11:15 PM to try to convince the victim to delay the presentation and allow for safety review.

3. **The confrontation** (medium difficulty, after admitting return): A will describe a tense but civil 20-minute conversation. A tried to convince the victim to wait, to think about the consequences. The victim refused, said A was being paranoid. A left frustrated but emphasizes that violence wasn't the answer - A's whole philosophy is about preventing harm.

4. **A's secret**: A had already sent the victim's research details to a journalist on Thursday afternoon, timed for publication Saturday morning. A knew this would destroy A's career and possibly expose A to legal action for breach of confidentiality, but A believed it was necessary to stop the technology. A returned to the house to warn the victim this was coming and offer one last chance to withdraw the presentation voluntarily. When the victim refused, A left, knowing the article would wreck both their careers. A needed the victim alive to face the consequences.

### Suspect B - Clues

**Observable clue about D**: If asked about the party atmosphere or who seemed upset, B might mention: "D looked pretty uncomfortable when Rachel gave her toast about the breakthrough. I remember because we'd grabbed lunch a few times, and I could tell something was eating at him. He barely stayed for a drink after the toast before making an excuse and leaving."

**Observable clue about A**: If asked about Friday morning reactions or who seemed suspicious, B might mention: "When we all heard about Rachel's death Friday morning, A looked absolutely terrified - not just sad or shocked, but panicked. She kept asking really specific questions about when the body was discovered, what time the police thought it happened, what evidence they found. It seemed... off. Like she was trying to figure out if she was in trouble rather than just grieving."

**Observable clue about C**: If asked about the party or people's behavior toward Rachel, B might mention: "C was really physically affectionate with Rachel at the party - lots of touching her arm, sitting really close, laughing at everything Rachel said. I remember thinking it seemed a bit intense for a mentor-mentee relationship. More like... I don't know, someone who was attracted to her?"

**Observable clue about D**: If asked about tension at work before the murder, B might mention: "The week before, I heard D and Rachel having what sounded like an argument in the break room. I couldn't hear details, but D's voice was raised. Rachel said something like 'I can't help that' and D said 'You could have at least...' then they noticed me and stopped. It was awkward."

1. **The forgotten jacket** (easy to discover): B will readily admit to returning to the house around midnight to retrieve a forgotten jacket. B will say nobody answered the door, so B left. B will seem nervous about this.

2. **The real reason** (medium difficulty): When pressed about why B was so concerned about a jacket to return at midnight, B will become defensive. Eventually B will admit: "Okay, I also thought maybe I could grab my USB drive. I'd been working on some files earlier and thought I left it there. But nobody answered, so I couldn't get in."

3. **The financial pressure** (medium-hard difficulty): When pressed about why he was so desperate to get files that night, B might reveal: "My spouse... she has a chronic condition. Medical bills. We're drowning. I thought maybe if I could get my hands on some of Rachel's work, I could... I don't know, use it for my own project, get a promotion, something. I wasn't thinking clearly."

4. **The corporate espionage** (hard to discover): Under intense pressure about what files B was really after, and whether B had a USB drive at the party at all, B will break down and admit: "It wasn't my idea. I was approached. They knew everything - where my spouse was born, the discrepancies in her visa application years ago, her social security number. They said copy Rachel's research by Friday or they'd report her to ICE. I had no choice. I tried to get the files remotely but couldn't access her home system. That's why I went back that night."

5. **The failed attempt** (hard difficulty): When pressed about exactly what happened at midnight, B reveals more details: "I didn't just ring the bell. I tried the windows - I was desperate. I could see into the living room - the lights were off downstairs but I saw a glow from upstairs, maybe the home office. I rang the bell three times, waited between each one. Nothing. I even tried calling her phone but it went to voicemail. I was there maybe 15 minutes total, panicking. Then I gave up and left."

6. **B's secret - The blackmail and E's car** (very hard to discover): When forced to explain everything about that night, B will reveal something he's been hiding: "When I got there around 12:15, I saw E's car parked on the next block. I recognized his parking sticker. I thought it was weird he'd park there instead of in front of the house, but I was too focused on my own problem. When I saw E's car parked there, I almost went to knock on his window - maybe he could help me get Rachel to answer. But something felt off. Why would he park on the next block instead of in front? His car was dark, empty. I thought maybe he'd already gone in through the back or something. After nobody answered Rachel's door, I left quickly - I didn't want E to see me lurking around if he came back." This places E at the scene after the murder.

### Suspect C - Clues

**Observable clue about D**: If asked about the party or who might have been upset, C might mention: "I noticed D left quite abruptly after Rachel's toast - right around 10 PM. He seemed... bothered by something. I wondered if he was feeling overshadowed. He and Rachel started around the same time, but Rachel's trajectory has been quite different."

**Observable clue about A**: If asked about who left and when, or anything unusual, C will mention: "As I was leaving around 11 PM, I actually saw A's car pull up and park down the street. I thought it was odd - the party was clearly winding down and most people had already left. I wondered if she'd forgotten something, but it seemed like strange timing. I didn't think much of it and went home."

**Observable clue about B**: If asked about the party or who seemed out of place, C might observe: "B was distracted all evening - kept checking his phone, seemed anxious. At one point I saw him near Rachel's home office when she was in the other room. When I asked if he needed something, he stammered about looking for the bathroom. But the bathroom's clearly marked. It stuck with me as odd."

**Observable clue about D**: If asked about who seemed upset at the party, C might mention: "D seemed really tense - not just uncomfortable, but almost angry. When Rachel was giving her toast, I glanced at D and the look on his face... it was intense. Not happy-for-a-colleague. More like... resentful? Hurt? I felt bad for him."

1. **The helpful colleague** (easy to discover): C will warmly describe helping the victim clean up after the party and working on presentation strategy. C will speak about the victim with obvious affection, calling them "brilliant" and "special."

2. **The time together** (easy to discover): C will admit to staying until 11:00 PM, later than everyone else except for the eventual return visits. C will describe it as natural: "We worked together so closely. I was invested in this presentation too."

3. **The relationship details** (medium difficulty): When asked about the victim's personal life, C knows a surprising amount - the victim's coffee preferences, their morning routine, the books on their nightstand. C may mention things that would only come from being in the victim's home before. When pressed, C will say: "We were close. I'd been there for dinners before, meetings, you know."

4. **C's secret**: C was obsessed with the victim and had been orchestrating an elaborate manipulation campaign for weeks. C knew about E and the victim's relationship (observed them, saw small tells). C deliberately created situations to spark E's jealousy: praising the victim effusively in E's presence, scheduling unnecessary late-night working sessions, touching the victim's arm or shoulder casually in front of E, making comments about their "special connection." At the party, C was especially demonstrative, hoping to push E over the edge into ending the relationship. C never imagined it would lead to murder. C is devastated and terrified that their manipulation caused this death.

### Suspect D - Clues

**D's Background Context**: D joined Frontier AI around the same time as the victim (February vs June). They initially bonded as young researchers finding their footing. But as the victim's research took off and achieved breakthrough results, D's more incremental work felt insignificant in comparison. D pulled back from the friendship out of hurt pride and professional jealousy. Recently had an argument with the victim about compute resource allocation. D left the party shortly after the victim's toast about the breakthrough - the comparison was too painful. **D is the primary red herring** - appears to have strong motive (jealousy, recent argument), weak initial alibi (lives alone, went home), and was seen on campus after the party. However, digital evidence ultimately clears D (DoorDash delivery at 11:15 PM at home, online game logs 11:28 PM-1:03 AM, neighbor noise complaint at 12:07 AM).

**Observable clue about A**: If asked about anyone acting strangely before the murder, D might mention: "Earlier in the week - Tuesday or Wednesday, I think - I was in the parking lot and overheard A on her phone. She was pacing by her car, talking to someone. I caught fragments like 'going public' and 'stopping this before it's too late' and something about 'no other choice.' Her voice sounded stressed, almost desperate. I figured it was about some safety review issue, but it stuck with me as unusually intense, even for A."

**Observable clue about C**: If asked about Rachel's relationships or who was close to her, D might observe: "C seemed really invested in Rachel - beyond normal mentorship. In meetings, I noticed C would find reasons to sit next to Rachel, touch her shoulder when making points, compliment her effusively. And the way C looked at Rachel sometimes... it seemed like more than professional admiration. I wondered if C had feelings for her."

1. **The early departure** (easy to discover): D will confirm attending the party and leaving around 10 PM. D is evasive and defensive about why he left. Will give minimal details initially. "It was a celebration. Normal office thing." Seems uncomfortable.

2. **The victim's announcement** (easy to discover): D will mention that during the party, the victim made a toast about the breakthrough and said "big changes are coming, both professionally and personally." When pressed about his reaction, D admits: "I left pretty soon after that. I'd had a long day." Evasive about why he left so quickly after the toast.

3. **No alibi - initial** (medium difficulty): When pressed about what he did after leaving, D says he went home alone. No roommate, no witnesses. Lives alone. Initially resists giving specific details, seems defensive. "I went home. That's it. What do you want from me?"

4. **The confrontation about the argument** (medium-hard difficulty): When confronted with B's account of the argument in the break room, D becomes more defensive: "Okay, yes, we had words earlier that week. Rachel got the GPU allocation I needed for my research. Again. I told her it wasn't fair that she always got priority. She said she needed it for the breakthrough. I was frustrated, but I didn't... I wouldn't hurt her over compute resources."

5. **The full jealousy admission** (hard to discover): When pressed harder about his feelings toward Rachel and why he really left the party, D finally breaks down: "Look, Rachel and I started around the same time. We were friends initially. But her research took off while mine... didn't. Her breakthrough made nine months of my work feel pointless. I was happy for her as a person, but watching everyone celebrate while I felt like a failure - I couldn't take it. I left early. But I didn't do anything to her. I thought about going back. To talk to her. To ask her to help me figure out what I was doing wrong. But I didn't. I just went home and had a miserable night alone."

6. **The alibi details** (hard to discover): Only when really pressed and appearing to realize he might be the prime suspect does D provide specifics: "Fine. I ordered Thai food from DoorDash at 10:47 PM - you can check. Driver delivered at 11:15 PM to my apartment. I was home. Then I played Valorant from about 11:30 to 1 AM - you can check the match history, I was online with random players. My neighbors probably heard me because I rage-quit around midnight and threw my controller. I'm not proud of it, but I was having a terrible night. Check if you don't believe me."

7. **The workplace observer** (medium difficulty, after being cleared): Once D's alibi is verified and he realizes he's no longer the prime suspect, he becomes more helpful. D noticed office dynamics and odd behavior from multiple people. D will mention that E seemed to leave the party very abruptly and looked upset. D also noticed that C was being very attentive to the victim during the party. When pressed about anything else unusual, D might mention: "B seemed really on edge lately - stressed about something. I saw him hanging around Rachel's office a few times when she wasn't there, which seemed odd. And he's been asking weirdly specific questions about her research setup."

8. **D's secret - The relationship** (very hard to discover, only after being cleared): D is extremely reluctant to reveal this because "I don't want to point fingers when I was just a suspect myself." Only when the player proves they're seriously investigating E does D reveal: "Months ago - maybe August - I was leaving the office really late, around 1 AM. I saw E and Rachel in the parking garage, sitting in E's car. They were... intimate. Kissing. I didn't say anything, just left quietly. It wasn't my business. I never mentioned it to anyone. But after that, I watched them sometimes. Small things - how E looked at her, how Rachel's mood would change when E was around. They were together. I'm sure of it. That's why I'm scared to tell you - if E found out I knew, and if E had something to do with this..." D trails off, clearly frightened.

### Suspect E - Clues

**Observable clue about D**: If asked who else seemed upset at the party, E might mention: "D left pretty quickly after Rachel's toast. I remember thinking he looked uncomfortable - maybe jealous? He and Rachel were both junior researchers, but she was getting all the attention."

**Observable clue about A**: If asked who else returned or anything unusual about the timeline, E might mention: "When I was driving back to Rachel's house around 11:45 PM, I noticed what looked like A's car leaving the area - dark sedan with a Frontier AI parking permit. I wasn't paying close attention at the time because I was... distracted by my own thoughts. But thinking back, it was definitely around that time."

**Observable clue about C**: When asked why he left early or what upset him, E might reveal with bitterness: "C. She was all over Rachel at the party - touching her constantly, laughing at everything Rachel said, sitting right next to her. Those 'late-night work sessions' they'd been having for weeks. The way C looked at Rachel... it was obvious what was going on. Or at least, I thought it was obvious. I couldn't stand watching it anymore, so I left." This is a crucial revelation that shows E's jealousy was specifically about C, and also suggests C's behavior was observable and deliberate.

**Observable clue about B**: If asked about unusual access requests or behavior in the weeks before, E might mention: "About two weeks ago, B requested access to Rachel's training logs and model checkpoints. Said he needed them for infrastructure optimization. I thought it was strange - that's not really his domain - but I approved it. He seemed really stressed about the timeline, kept saying it was urgent."

1. **The early exit** (easy to discover): E will admit to leaving the party around 9:30 PM with a headache. E will claim to have gone home, worked for a while, and gone to bed around midnight. E will seem calm but somewhat flat emotionally.

2. **The relationship** (hard to discover): E will initially deny any romantic relationship with the victim. Only when confronted with evidence (D's observation, the victim's comment about "personal changes," C's knowledge of the relationship) will E admit that they had been secretly seeing the victim for about six months.

3. **The jealousy** (medium difficulty, after relationship is revealed): When asked about C, E's composure will crack. E will make bitter comments about C "all over" the victim at the party, about how the victim "didn't even notice how inappropriate it was," about "late night work sessions." E's pain and anger will be evident.

4. **E's confession**: When confronted with the evidence - the relationship, the jealousy of C, the early departure suggesting E was too upset to stay, the victim's computer being active at 11:43 PM (suggesting someone was there after A left at 11:40), and perhaps the neighbor's account of someone in the back yard at midnight - E will break down. E will admit to returning, to the confrontation, to not believing the victim's denials about C. E will describe the rage, the strangling, the panic, the staging. E will express horrified regret: "I killed them because I thought they were lying to me. But they weren't. C was just playing games, and I fell for it. I murdered the person I loved for nothing."

13. **D is cleared** → Could not have committed murder between 11:45 PM-12:10 AM
14. **D becomes cooperative** → Now willing to share observations about B, C, and especially E
15. **Press D about E** → D reluctantly reveals seeing E and Rachel together months ago
16. **Use D's information to investigate E** → Focus shifts to real killer

## Critique

### Difficulty Balance

**Strengths**:
- The home setting eliminates the "office security cameras everywhere" problem naturally
- Multiple suspects returning to the house creates several investigative threads
- No access log means players must discover returns through interrogation, not just data review
- **Four distinct approaches** (returns, relationships, timeline, red herring D) provide multiple entry points
- Secrets are layered: easy admissions (being at party), medium difficulty (returning to house), hard (true motives)
- Players don't need to discover C's manipulation to solve the case, but it enriches the story
- E's early departure is visible to everyone, providing an entry point without being too obvious
- **D functions as a strong red herring**: clear motive (professional jealousy + recent argument), weak alibi initially (lives alone), suspicious behavior (seen on campus late, defensive, evasive), but ultimately cleared by digital evidence
- Observable clues about B's espionage come from multiple sources (A, C, D, E), making it discoverable through various paths
- D's cooperation increases after being cleared, creating a natural progression from suspect to witness

**Potential issues**:
- Might be too easy if players immediately focus on who left early and was upset
  - Mitigation: **D appears more suspicious than E initially** (angry at party, recent argument, no alibi at first); A has the strongest apparent motive; B and A both returned; E claims simple headache and maintains composure
- Multiple people returning might seem contrived
  - Mitigation: Each has a distinct, believable reason; this is more natural than everyone being at an isolated lab
- No security footage might make it harder to catch E
  - Mitigation: Computer timestamp, neighbor sighting, B seeing E's car, and interrogation-driven investigation fits the dialogue-based game format better
- D's digital alibi might feel too convenient
  - Mitigation: Alibi is realistic (food delivery, online games, noise complaint) and requires player to actively investigate; D doesn't volunteer details initially

**Assessment**: This version errs on "accessible" difficulty. The home setting feels natural, and the party provides a reason for everyone to be there without contrivance. Multiple return visits create investigative depth, and discovering who returned when becomes a core challenge that drives interrogation.

### Plot Clarity

**Strengths**:
- Single location (victim's home) is intuitive and easy to visualize
- Clear motive chain: C's manipulation → E's jealousy → confrontation → murder → staging
- The party provides natural reason for all suspects to be there
- Timeline is straightforward: party ends around 10:30, returns happen between 11:15-12:15
- Each suspect has a distinct arc and secret that serves the plot
- The "personal changes" comment from victim points toward E relationship reveal
- Staging as accident adds a layer (why would E stage it?) that players can discover
- **D's arc as red herring is clear**: Suspect → Investigation → Cleared → Witness, creating satisfying progression
- D's jealousy motive is more obvious than E's relationship motive, naturally drawing initial suspicion
- Multiple suspects provide observable clues about each other, creating web of information

**Potential issues**:
- Players might get confused about who returned when
  - Mitigation: Only three people returned (A, E, B), and B never got in; focus is on A and E; D stayed away (has alibi)
- C's manipulation might be too subtle
  - Mitigation: E's jealousy is visible even without understanding C's full role; thorough investigation reveals the tragic manipulation
- D's progression from suspect to witness might confuse some players
  - Mitigation: Clear alibi verification makes the transition explicit; D's cooperation after being cleared feels natural

**Assessment**: The plot is cleaner than v3's Innovation Lab scenario. Everyone being at a party is more natural than everyone being invited to review a demo. The home setting avoids security system questions while still allowing for some evidence (computer timestamp, neighbor sighting).

### Plausibility Concerns

**Addressed**:
- ✓ Why no security cameras: Residential home, not a facility
- ✓ Why everyone was there: Social party, normal workplace gathering
- ✓ Why back door accessible: E knew where spare key was (intimate relationship detail)
- ✓ Why no one saw E return: Back entrance, late night, residential area
- ✓ Why victim let A in for confrontation: Trusted colleague, hadn't fought yet
- ✓ Why E thought they could get away with it: Crime of passion, not premeditated; staging shows panic attempt at cover-up
- ✓ Why no phone evidence mentioned: Investigation just started Friday, full digital forensics pending

**Potential issues**:

- Why didn't neighbors notice multiple returns?
  - Mitigation: Late night, people coming and going from parties is normal, residential area where people mind their business

- How did E get victim to home office for confrontation?
  - Mitigation: Victim was already there working on slides; E found them there

- Why stage as accident if strangulation is obvious?
  - Mitigation: E panicked, wasn't thinking clearly, hoped initial assessment would miss strangulation evidence

- Wouldn't there be more physical evidence?
  - Mitigation: E and victim were in relationship, so E's DNA/fingerprints being present is explained; game focuses on interrogation, not forensics

- Why would E use back door if has spare key to front?
  - Mitigation: Didn't want to be seen at front door; back entrance through yard is more concealed

**Overall Assessment**:

This version trades v3's "everyone at isolated lab" scenario for a more natural "party at victim's home" setting. The residential location eliminates most security camera plausibility issues while still allowing for some evidence (computer activity, neighbor sighting).

The difficulty level is appropriate - multiple entry points, clear clues, but requires active interrogation to discover who returned when and why. The investigation is driven by dialogue and catching lies, not by reviewing access logs.

The emotional core is strong: E's jealousy driven by C's manipulation leads to a tragedy where E kills the person they love based on manufactured suspicions. This is discoverable through multiple paths but doesn't require understanding every subplot.

**Key improvement from v3**: The home/party setting feels more natural than the Innovation Lab, and eliminating the access log makes the investigation more about interrogation and less about data analysis. Multiple return visits create investigative depth without feeling contrived - people forget things, people want private conversations, people have ulterior motives.

The game remains dialogue-focused and doesn't require complex timeline puzzles. Players can solve it by following relationships, following timeline, or following the returns, and all paths lead to E through different sets of clues.
