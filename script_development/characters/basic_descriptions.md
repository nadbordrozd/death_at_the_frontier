**Role at Frontier AI**: Senior Research Scientist, AI Safety Team

**Public Background**:
Nadia has been with Frontier AI for four years, making her one of the more tenured researchers. She leads safety evaluations for new model releases and is known for her passionate advocacy for responsible AI development. Colleagues describe her as intense, principled, and occasionally difficult to work with when she believes safety concerns are being overlooked.

Nadia immigrated to the US for graduate school and has built her entire career in American tech. She was one of Rachel's early mentors when Rachel first joined, though their relationship had become more distant as Rachel's capabilities research diverged from Nadia's safety focus.

## Suspect B: Marcus Liu

**Full Name**: Marcus Wei Liu  
**Age**: 33  
**Gender**: Male  
**Ethnicity**: Chinese American  
**Role at Frontier AI**: Senior Data Engineer, Infrastructure Team

**Public Background**:
Marcus has been with Frontier AI for three years, working on the backend infrastructure that supports model training and evaluation. He's well-liked but keeps mostly to himself, known as a quiet, reliable worker who gets things done without fanfare.

Marcus is married and generally doesn't participate much in office social events, though he attended Rachel's party at her invitation. Colleagues know little about his personal life beyond the basics.

## Suspect C: Christopher Morrison

**Full Name**: Christopher James Morrison  
**Age**: 38  
**Gender**: Male  
**Ethnicity**: White American  
**Role at Frontier AI**: Principal Research Scientist, Research Director

**Public Background**:
Christopher — "Chris" to everyone — is one of Frontier AI's most senior researchers. He joined as a founding team member and has been instrumental in shaping the company's research direction. He officially serves as a mentor to several junior researchers, including Rachel.

Chris is known for his sharp intellect, his demanding standards, and his close involvement in the work of researchers he mentors. Some find his warmth and attention flattering; others find his intensity uncomfortable. He and Rachel had been working closely together on the breakthrough presentation.

## Suspect D: Dr. Emily Zhang

**Full Name**: Dr. Emily Mei Zhang, PhD  
**Age**: 28  
**Gender**: Female  
**Ethnicity**: Chinese American  
**Role at Frontier AI**: Research Scientist, Capabilities Team

**Public Background**:
Emily completed her PhD at MIT at 26, following a more traditional academic timeline. She joined Frontier AI in February of last year, just a few months before Rachel. The two started as peers and initially bonded over being the newest PhDs on the research team. However, as Rachel's star rose rapidly, Emily's more methodical research trajectory felt slower by comparison — particularly galling given that Emily was two years older and had taken longer to complete her doctorate.

Emily is known for being sharp, competitive, and sometimes guarded. She's respected for her technical abilities but has fewer close friendships at the company than Rachel did. Colleagues have noticed tension between them in recent months.

Vikram is known for being calm, professional, and measured in his demeanor. He maintains appropriate boundaries between his leadership role and the research teams, though he works closely with all departments. He attended Rachel's party briefly, as he does most team social events, and left early citing a headache.
