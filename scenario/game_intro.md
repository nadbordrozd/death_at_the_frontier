Dr. Rachel Miller was supposed to change the world today.

Instead, she's in the morgue.

The 24-year-old AI prodigy was found dead this morning at the bottom of her basement stairs. It looked like a drunken fall — until the medical examiner found ligature marks on her neck.

**Someone strangled her. Then staged it to look like an accident.**

Last night, Rachel hosted a party to celebrate her breakthrough research. Fifteen colleagues. Wine. Laughter. By 11 PM, everyone had gone home.

By 1 AM, she was dead.

We've brought in five people from Frontier AI for questioning. All attended the party. All knew the victim. All have something to hide.

One of them is the murderer, and everyone else present at the party has an alibi.

Find out who.
